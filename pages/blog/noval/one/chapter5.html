                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Section 5: Remains in the Container</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">直升机的探照灯扫了一圈，嗡嗡声渐渐远去，南门恢复了电力，黑暗消除后一片狼藉。我和安德利带着几个警员四处搜查，空气里还飘着火药和烧焦橡胶的味儿，刺得人鼻子发酸。就在一堆歪七扭八的集装箱后面，一个警员喊了声："这儿有东西！"我们跑过去一看，是具尸体，塞在集装箱缝里，半边身子被烧得焦黑，战术背心还挂在身上，枪套里空荡荡的，显然被人搜走了武器。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The helicopter's searchlight swept around one last time, its humming gradually fading away. Power had been restored to the southern gate, revealing the mess once darkness was eliminated. Andrey and I, along with several officers, searched everywhere. The air still carried the smell of gunpowder and burned rubber, stinging our noses. Behind a pile of crooked containers, an officer shouted: "There's something here!" We ran over to find a body wedged in the gap between containers, half of it charred black, with a tactical vest still hanging on it. The holster was empty, its weapon clearly taken.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">安德利蹲下去，借着手电光瞅了眼，啧啧两声："这家伙没跑掉，多半是我刚才崩的。"他指着尸体肩膀上的弹孔，咧嘴笑了，"这该死的世界，跑得再快也躲不过我的枪。"我没理他这自夸，盯着那具尸体琢磨。战术装备齐全，消声手枪的弹壳散在旁边，这可不是街头混混能搞来的玩意儿。大伙儿围着议论，有人低声嘀咕："雇佣兵吧？看这架势不像本地帮派。"没人敢打包票，但这想法在我脑子里转了一圈，越来越觉得靠谱。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey crouched down, examining it under the flashlight, making a couple of clicking sounds: "This guy didn't get away, probably one I shot earlier." He pointed at the bullet hole in the body's shoulder, grinning, "In this damned world, no matter how fast you run, you can't escape my gun." I ignored his boasting, staring at the body and thinking. The tactical equipment was complete, with silenced pistol casings scattered nearby—something street thugs couldn't possibly obtain. Everyone gathered around discussing, with someone muttering: "Mercenaries? Doesn't look like a local gang with this setup." No one could say for certain, but the idea circled in my mind, seeming increasingly plausible.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">就在这时，身后传来脚步声，沉稳得像踩着鼓点。我回头一看，两个身影从黑暗里走出来，警灯的红蓝光打在他们脸上，照得一清二楚。前面的是刑警警长莱门斯，六十多岁，西装革履，领带打得一丝不苟，脸上挂着那种让人捉摸不透的笑。他头发花白，眼角皱纹深得像刻出来的，可步伐稳健得不像个快退休的老头。我一眼就认出他——退役狙击手出身，政界检察院派系的红人，人脉广得能从梅罗德港口铺到联邦首都。局里都说他心善，可我总觉得他眼神里藏着点狡猾，像只老狐狸。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just then, footsteps came from behind, steady as if marking a drumbeat. I turned to see two figures emerging from the darkness, the red and blue lights of the police vehicles illuminating their faces clearly. The one in front was Criminal Investigation Captain Lemons, in his sixties, dressed in a suit and tie, meticulously groomed, with an inscrutable smile on his face. His hair was graying, with wrinkles around his eyes that seemed carved in, yet his stride was too steady for a man nearing retirement. I recognized him immediately—a retired sniper, a favorite in the prosecutor's office political circles, with connections stretching from Melrod Port to the federal capital. People at the station said he was kind-hearted, but I always felt his eyes concealed a bit of cunning, like an old fox.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">后面跟着的是警监科尔，二十六岁，个子挺拔，短发修得整齐，脸上还带着点刚出校园的青涩。他穿着警服，手里拿着表单，走路时肩膀微微晃，像在观察周围的一切。这家伙是联邦政法大学的高材生，硕士刚毕业就进了局里，射击和推理都是一把好手，第六感敏锐得吓人。打过几次交道，他也有毛病，太固执，太理想化，嫉恶如仇到有点一根筋，心理素质还没完全跟上这行的血腥。听说他一心想往上爬，可又对法律执着得跟念经似的。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Following behind was Inspector Cole, twenty-six years old, tall and straight, with neatly trimmed short hair, still showing a hint of the freshness of someone just out of college. He wore his uniform, holding forms in his hand, shoulders slightly swaying as he walked, as if observing everything around him. This guy was a top graduate from the Federal University of Political Science and Law, entering the bureau right after completing his master's degree. He was skilled in both shooting and reasoning, with a frighteningly keen sixth sense. From our few interactions, I knew he had his flaws—too stubborn, too idealistic, with a hatred of evil so intense it made him somewhat single-minded. His psychological resilience hadn't quite caught up with the bloodiness of this job. I'd heard he was ambitious to climb the ranks, yet clung to the law with an almost religious devotion.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"维尔纳，"莱门斯开口了，声音低沉，带点沙哑，"没想到你也在现场。"他瞥了眼尸体，又看看我，嘴角微微上扬，像在掂量什么。我耸耸肩，回道："任务暂停了，临时被抓来的壮丁，警长，您老这是亲自出马？"他没直接答，笑了笑，拍拍我肩膀："这事不小，我也算是老资历，事事都不放心，而且检察院、市政还有安全局的人都盯着呢。我得以身作则，做个榜样。一个好的警察，必须要眼观六路、耳听八方，这里一定有很多细节。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Werner," Lemons spoke up, his voice deep with a hint of hoarseness, "I didn't expect to see you at the scene." He glanced at the body, then looked at me, his lips curling slightly upward as if weighing something. I shrugged and replied: "My mission's on hold, I was drafted as temporary help. Captain, you're personally taking the field?" He didn't answer directly, just smiled and patted my shoulder: "This is no small matter, and with my experience, I'm concerned about everything. Plus, the prosecutor's office, city administration, and Security Bureau are all watching. I need to lead by example. A good police officer must observe in all directions and listen from all sides—there must be many details here."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔走上前，蹲下仔细检查尸体，手指轻轻拨开战术背心上的烧痕，低声说："雇佣兵的可能性很高，装备是军用级别，训练痕迹明显。"他抬头看了我一眼，眼神锐利得像刀子，"现在这已经不是普通的袭击，而是一起蓄谋已久的、背后有更大的动机的武装袭击，港口有什么值得他们如此冒险？"他语气斩钉截铁，可说完后又皱了下眉，像在掩饰心里的不安。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole stepped forward, crouched down to carefully examine the body, his fingers gently pushing aside the burn marks on the tactical vest, saying softly: "There's a high probability these are mercenaries; the equipment is military-grade, with obvious signs of training." He looked up at me, his gaze sharp as a knife, "This is no longer an ordinary attack, but a premeditated armed assault with greater motives behind it. What at the port is worth such a risk for them?" His tone was decisive, but after speaking, he frowned, as if hiding his uneasiness.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我没接话，心里却犯嘀咕，今天晚上鬼知道谁是敌谁是友。而且这俩人立场不明，莱门斯老练得像个政客，科尔正义得有点天真，可他们都不是省油的灯。局里传言他俩破案效率高，但手段不总是干净，暴力甚至非法活动都沾过边，可又没留下把柄。莱门斯通晓人情世故，科尔情商高得能把死人说活，我一时半会儿也看不出他们到底站在哪边。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I didn't respond, but my mind was troubled. Tonight, who knew who was friend or foe? Besides, these two men's stances were unclear. Lemons was as seasoned as a politician, Cole was almost naively righteous, but neither was easy to deal with. Rumors at the bureau said they had high case-solving efficiency, but their methods weren't always clean—touching on violence and even illegal activities, yet never leaving evidence behind. Lemons was well-versed in human affairs, while Cole had such high emotional intelligence he could talk a dead man back to life. For the moment, I couldn't tell whose side they were really on.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">安德利站起身，点了根烟，吐了个烟圈，插嘴道："这该死的世界，不管谁干的，总得有人收拾烂摊子。咱们打算怎么查？"莱门斯瞥了他一眼，一副沉思的样子，"科尔是新来警局的高材生，我认为我们很有必要听听他的建议"，科尔认真回道："扩大搜查，查港口的出入记录、账户、资产、负责人和利益相关体，看看能不能挖出线索。"他顿了顿，又加了句，"法律会给我们答案。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey stood up, lit a cigarette, blew a smoke ring, and interjected: "In this damned world, regardless of who did it, someone has to clean up the mess. How do we plan to investigate?" Lemons glanced at him, appearing thoughtful, "Cole is a talented newcomer to the police station. I think we should hear his suggestions." Cole replied seriously: "Expand the search, check the port's entry and exit records, accounts, assets, persons in charge, and stakeholders to see if we can dig up any clues." He paused, then added, "The law will give us answers."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我点点头，心里却不置可否。"说得对，一切都很可以，维护正义和真理总是需要做足准备。现在，大家两人一组去找自己的活干，科尔负责安排具体工作。"莱门斯说道。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I nodded, though internally I was noncommittal. "That's right, everything is feasible. Upholding justice and truth always requires thorough preparation. Now, everyone pair up and find your tasks. Cole will be responsible for arranging specific work," Lemons said.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">离开时，我回头看了眼那具尸体，烧焦的战术背心里好像塞着什么东西，可刚才没人注意。或许是张纸，或许是别的玩意儿。我没吭声，心里记下这茬，打算回头再找机会瞧瞧。这晚上，乱得像一锅粥，可总有些东西藏在水底下，等着浮上来。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">As I left, I looked back at the body. There seemed to be something stuffed in the charred tactical vest that no one had noticed. Perhaps a piece of paper, perhaps something else. I didn't say anything, but made a mental note, planning to find an opportunity to check it later. This night was as chaotic as a pot of porridge, but there were always things hidden at the bottom, waiting to surface.</p>
