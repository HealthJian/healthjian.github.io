                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Section 6: Smoke Rings by the Shore</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">没等我们喘口气，三区那边又炸了锅。一阵急促的枪声从不远处传来，夹杂着警员的喊叫和人群的尖叫。我和安德利刚站起身，就听见"轰"的一声巨响，震得地面都晃了晃。警员们骂骂咧咧地往那边冲，我俩跟在后面跑过去一看，一辆白色皮卡停在街中央，车身炸得稀烂，冒着黑烟，周围散落着玻璃碎片和烧焦的零件。人群乱成一团，幸好没死人，只是几个倒霉蛋被炸飞的碎片划伤，捂着胳膊腿在地上嚎。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Before we could catch our breath, District Three erupted again. A burst of rapid gunfire came from not far away, mixed with the shouts of officers and screams of the crowd. Andrey and I had just stood up when we heard a loud "boom" that shook the ground. Officers cursed as they rushed toward the scene. We followed behind and saw a white pickup truck stopped in the middle of the street, its body completely wrecked, emitting black smoke, with glass shards and charred parts scattered around. The crowd was in chaos, but fortunately, no one died. Just a few unlucky ones who were cut by flying debris, holding their arms and legs while howling on the ground.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">这帮家伙跟南门那队不一样，装备没那么精良，冲锋枪换成了老式手枪，可行动明显经过筹划。他们趁乱从街角窜出来，打了几梭子就跑，像是没跑干净的漏网之鱼。警员们追上去，枪声断断续续响了一阵，很快就安静下来。科尔站在炸毁的桥车旁，皱着眉检查现场，低声对旁边的警员说："这不是同一伙人，但绝对也不是临时起意，更像是调虎离山之类的手段。"他抬头看了我们一眼，没多说，转身去布置封锁线。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">This group was different from the one at the southern gate. Their equipment wasn't as sophisticated, with submachine guns replaced by old-style handguns, but their actions had clearly been planned. They took advantage of the chaos to emerge from the street corner, fired a few bursts, and then ran, like escapees who hadn't completely gotten away. Officers chased after them, with gunfire sounding intermittently for a while before quickly quieting down. Cole stood by the destroyed bridge vehicle, frowning as he examined the scene, saying quietly to a nearby officer, "These aren't the same people, but it's definitely not an impulsive act either, more like a diversionary tactic." He glanced at us, said nothing more, and turned to set up a cordon.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯站在不远处，点了根雪茄，吐了口烟雾，慢条斯理地对几个警员下命令："守住三区外围，别让记者进来，把现场交给联邦的人。"说完他拍拍手，转身走了。我听见他嘀咕了句："明天早上的发布会，得好好准备。"那语气平静得像在聊天气，可我总觉得他心里有别的盘算。这老狐狸，六十多岁了还忙着站台，退休前的最后一把火，怕是烧得比谁都旺。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons stood not far away, lit a cigar, exhaled some smoke, and unhurriedly gave orders to several officers: "Guard the outskirts of District Three, don't let journalists in, and hand the scene over to the federal people." With that, he clapped his hands and walked away. I heard him mutter, "Tomorrow morning's press conference needs thorough preparation." His tone was as calm as if discussing the weather, but I always felt he had other plans in mind. This old fox, over sixty and still busy making appearances—his final blaze before retirement was likely to burn brighter than anyone else's.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我和安德利没跟着凑热闹，溜到港口岸边坐下。面前是大火滚滚的港口，浓烟翻腾着往天上窜，海风吹过来，带着股咸腥味。我点了根烟递给安德利，他接过去，眯着眼吐了个烟圈："这该死的世界，真是没一天消停。"他顿了顿，声音低下去，"我打算干完这阵子就走，市政那边的养老金申请下来了，贷款快还够了，回老家当农场主，喝点酒，过几天安稳日子。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey and I didn't join the commotion, instead slipping away to sit by the port's edge. Before us was the port engulfed in raging fires, with thick smoke billowing into the sky, and the sea breeze bringing a salty, fishy smell. I lit a cigarette and handed it to Andrey, who took it, narrowed his eyes, and blew a smoke ring: "This damned world really doesn't have a quiet day." He paused, his voice lowering, "I plan to leave after finishing this stint. The pension application from the municipality has been approved, and I've almost paid off my loan. I'll go back to my hometown to be a farmer, drink a bit, and enjoy some peaceful days."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我抽了口烟，没吭声。老家？他老家是个靠海的小镇，风景是不错，可我想象不出安德利这家伙扛着锄头种地的样子。他瞥了我一眼，笑了："你呢？卢卡斯，别告诉我你还想在这破地方耗一辈子。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I took a drag on my cigarette, saying nothing. Hometown? His hometown was a coastal town with nice scenery, but I couldn't imagine Andrey carrying a hoe and farming. He glanced at me and smiled, "What about you? Lucas, don't tell me you still want to spend your whole life in this wretched place."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我盯着港口的火光，脑子里一片迷雾。未来的打算？我从没认真想过。记者的身份是假的，警官的活儿是脏的，梅罗德这城市像个吸血鬼，榨干了你的力气还让你离不开。我吐了口烟，苦笑道："我也不知道，兴许哪天挨一枪就完事了。"安德利哈哈一笑，拍拍我肩膀："别这么丧，这该死的世界还没玩死咱们呢。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I stared at the firelight of the port, my mind in a fog. Future plans? I had never seriously thought about it. My identity as a journalist was fake, my work as an officer was dirty, and this city called Melrod was like a vampire, sucking out all your energy yet still keeping you from leaving. I exhaled some smoke and said with a bitter smile, "I don't know either. Maybe one day I'll take a bullet and that'll be it." Andrey laughed and patted my shoulder, "Don't be so gloomy. This damned world hasn't finished us off yet."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"但是我还真找不到该干什么？自从当上警察，我已经连爱好都没有了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"But I really can't figure out what I should do. Since becoming a police officer, I've lost even my hobbies."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"找女人，喝酒，赌钱？和我这个乡巴佬不一样，实在不行找个书念?我记得你成绩挺好的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Find women, drink, gamble? Unlike me, a country bumpkin, if all else fails, maybe find a book to study? I remember your grades were pretty good."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"唉，我现在真怀疑我当初为什么敢当警察。操。钱少事多，关键时候还得送命。今天咱们局已经搭进去两条人命了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Sigh, I really doubt now why I dared to become a police officer in the first place. Damn. Little money, lots of work, and at critical moments, you have to risk your life. Our bureau has already lost two lives today."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"的确，但是看开点卢卡斯。别指望去指责那个曾经的自己，他当时也是个傻小子，没准和你现在一样迷茫。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Indeed, but try to be more open-minded, Lucas. Don't expect to blame your former self. He was just a foolish young man then, probably as confused as you are now."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">听完我的心里好受多了，笑着调侃道："你他妈什么时候也学会说这些屁话的？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Hearing this, I felt better and joked with a smile, "When the hell did you learn to talk such nonsense?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"老兄，要想混就得先会说话。科尔那个小鬼不就是靠着一张好嘴，可能给某个大人物口过，或是政客太太吹过才有的今天？能力在情商面前一文不值！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Man, if you want to get by, you first need to know how to talk. Isn't that little punk Cole where he is today because of his smooth talk, possibly having served some big shot, or sweet-talked a politician's wife? Ability is worthless in the face of emotional intelligence!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我没再回他，两人就在那里抽烟。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I didn't respond further, and the two of us just sat there smoking.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">岸边渐渐热闹起来，消防局的卡车轰隆隆开进来，水枪喷得哗哗响。海关和税务局的人穿着荧光马甲，忙着清点爆炸后的残骸。海军陆战队和联邦安全局的家伙也到了，黑压压一片，个个绷着脸，像要打仗似的。市政的人夹在中间，喊着要"协调资源"，结果谁也不听谁的，乱得像菜市场。我和安德利对视一眼，懒得掺和，继续抽我们的烟。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The shore gradually became bustling, with fire department trucks rumbling in, their water guns spraying loudly. Customs and tax bureau personnel in fluorescent vests were busy taking inventory of the explosion's debris. The Marines and Federal Security Bureau guys had also arrived, a dark mass with everyone wearing tense expressions, as if preparing for war. The municipal people were caught in the middle, shouting about "coordinating resources," but no one was listening to anyone else—it was as chaotic as a marketplace. Andrey and I exchanged a glance, not bothering to get involved, and continued smoking our cigarettes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">火光映在海面上，像一层跳动的红纱。这晚上，乱七八糟的人都来了，可真正的麻烦，怕是还没露头。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The firelight reflected on the sea's surface, like a layer of dancing red gauze. This evening, all sorts of chaotic people had arrived, but the real trouble, I feared, had yet to show itself.</p>
