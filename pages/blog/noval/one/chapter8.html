                    <p class="zh-content">维克托刚洗完手，门又被推开了，这次进来的是莱门斯和科尔。莱门斯还是那副西装革履的绅士模样，雪茄的烟味儿随着他飘进来，混着验尸房的消毒水味儿，呛得人皱眉。他扫了眼屋里的尸体，嘴角微微上扬，像在看一场不太有趣的戏。科尔跟在他后面，警服笔挺，手里拿着一摞文件，眼底带着点没睡好的倦意，但眼神还是锐利得像刀子。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Viktor had just finished washing his hands when the door was pushed open again. This time, it was Lemons and Cole who entered. Lemons still had that gentlemanly appearance, dressed in a suit, with the smell of cigars wafting in with him, mixing with the disinfectant odor of the morgue, making people wrinkle their brows. He swept his eyes over the bodies in the room, the corners of his mouth slightly turning upward, as if watching a not-so-interesting play. Cole followed behind him, in a crisp uniform, holding a stack of documents, with a hint of sleeplessness in his eyes, but his gaze was still sharp as a knife.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"维克托，"莱门斯开了口，声音低沉平稳，"听说你这儿有新货，查出什么没有？"他走到那具烧焦的尸体旁，低头瞥了眼，像是随口问问，可那语气里藏着点让人不舒服的压迫感。维克托靠在水槽边，擦着手，懒洋洋地回道："刚剖完一个，军用装备，子弹改装过，胃里还没来得及看。想知道更多？等我忙完再说。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Viktor," Lemons began, his voice deep and steady, "I heard you've got new arrivals here. Found anything?" He walked to the charred body, glanced down at it, as if asking casually, but there was a hint of uncomfortable pressure hidden in his tone. Viktor leaned against the sink, wiping his hands, and replied lazily: "Just finished dissecting one. Military equipment, modified bullets, haven't had time to check the stomach yet. Want to know more? Wait until I'm done."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔没等莱门斯接话，径直走过来，蹲下盯着尸体肩膀上的弹孔，低声说："这伤口角度很准，应该是近距离射击。"他抬头看了安德利一眼，"你下的手？"安德利吐了个烟圈，咧嘴一笑："总得有人开枪。没错，是我崩的。"科尔笑了一下，没吭声，转身翻开手里的文件，像在核对什么。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole didn't wait for Lemons to respond. He walked straight over, crouched down, and stared at the bullet wound on the body's shoulder, saying in a low voice: "The angle of this wound is very precise. It must have been a close-range shot." He looked up at Andrey, "Your work?" Andrey blew a smoke ring, grinning: "Someone had to pull the trigger. Yeah, I shot him." Cole smiled slightly without saying anything, then turned to open the files in his hands, as if checking something.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我站在旁边，手里还拿着那张烧焦的纸，正准备汇报。莱门斯像是察觉了什么，眼神扫过来，淡淡问："卢卡斯，你那儿拿着什么？"他语气平静，可那双眼睛像能把人看穿。我把纸递过去："从尸体兜里掏出来的，烧得认不清了，就几个字母，'K…R…S'。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I stood nearby, still holding that charred piece of paper, about to report. Lemons seemed to sense something, his gaze sweeping over to me, asking calmly: "Lucas, what are you holding there?" His tone was calm, but those eyes seemed able to see right through people. I handed the paper over: "Pulled it from the body's pocket. It's burnt beyond recognition, just a few letters, 'K...R...S'."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯接过去，皱了皱眉，眯眼看了看，随手递给科尔："查查港口的出入记录，看看有没有吻合的。我感觉更像是这个士兵的身份证件。"科尔点点头，接过纸，低头在文件里翻找，嘴里嘀咕："如果是名字，可能是某个关键人物。如果是代号，那就麻烦了。"他语气认真得像在课堂上答题，可手指微微抖了下，显然这晚上的乱局让他有点绷不住。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons took it, furrowed his brow, squinted at it, and casually handed it to Cole: "Check the port entry and exit records, see if there's any match. I feel it's more likely to be this soldier's ID." Cole nodded, took the paper, and looked down, searching through his files, muttering: "If it's a name, it could be a key figure. If it's a code, that's trouble." His tone was as serious as if answering in class, but his fingers trembled slightly—clearly, the chaos of the night was getting to him.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">维克托插嘴道："你们要是急着要线索，我先把胃掏了。兴许这家伙死前吃了顿大餐，能告诉你们他从哪儿来的。"他语气里带着点调侃，可眼睛却冷冷地盯着莱门斯，像在试探什么。莱门斯哼笑一声，拍拍手："那就辛苦你了，维克托。明天早上的发布会还得靠你给点料。"说完他转身往外走，扔下一句，"科尔，留下盯着，别让线索跑了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Viktor interjected: "If you're in a hurry for clues, I'll extract the stomach first. Perhaps this guy had a big meal before dying, which could tell you where he came from." There was a hint of mockery in his tone, but his eyes coldly stared at Lemons, as if probing something. Lemons snorted a laugh, clapping his hands: "Then I'll trouble you, Viktor. Tomorrow morning's press conference will depend on you for some information." With that, he turned to leave, tossing back, "Cole, stay and keep an eye on things. Don't let any clues escape."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔没动，低头继续翻文件，偶尔抬头看一眼维克托手里的解剖刀。迈克忍不住嘀咕："这老家伙一走就甩锅，发布会的事儿八成又得咱们擦屁股。"托马斯站在角落，冷冷地瞥了他一眼，没吭声。我和安德利对视一眼，心里都明白：莱门斯这趟来不是随便看看，他想要的东西，怕是比这屋里的尸体还多。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole didn't move, continuing to flip through the files, occasionally looking up at the scalpel in Viktor's hand. Mike couldn't help muttering: "This old guy just passes the buck as soon as he leaves. The press conference stuff will probably be left for us to clean up." Thomas stood in the corner, giving him a cold glance without saying a word. Andrey and I exchanged a look, both understanding: Lemons didn't come here just for a casual look. What he wanted was probably more than the bodies in this room.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">维克托重新拿起刀，低声对我说："卢卡斯，那张纸你留个心眼。这城市，水深得很。"他没抬头，手上动作却没停。我点点头，把这话记在心里。科尔突然抬起头，盯着我手里的烟，问："维尔纳，你觉得这事是帮派干的，还是更大？"他语气里带着点试探，像在掂量我的立场。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Viktor picked up the knife again, saying to me in a low voice: "Lucas, keep an eye on that paper. This city's waters run deep." He didn't look up, but his hands didn't stop working. I nodded, taking his words to heart. Cole suddenly looked up, staring at the cigarette in my hand, and asked: "Werner, do you think this was done by gangs, or something bigger?" There was a hint of probing in his tone, as if weighing my stance.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我抽了口烟，吐出去，慢悠悠地说："帮派没这能耐，可谁有这能耐，我也不知道。"科尔皱了下眉，没追问，低头继续忙他的。安德利拍拍我肩膀，低声说："这该死的世界，问再多也没用，反正死的不是咱们。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I took a drag on my cigarette, exhaled, and said slowly: "Gangs don't have this capability, but who does, I don't know either." Cole frowned slightly, didn't pursue it further, and went back to his work. Andrey patted my shoulder, saying in a low voice: "In this damned world, asking more questions won't help. At least we're not the ones who died."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">验尸房里冷光灯嗡嗡作响，空气里混着血腥和烟草味儿。莱门斯走了，科尔留下了，可这屋里的气氛却越来越沉，像有什么东西在暗处盯着，等着跳出来。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The cold fluorescent lights in the morgue hummed, the air filled with the scent of blood and tobacco. Lemons had left, Cole had stayed, but the atmosphere in the room grew increasingly heavy, as if something in the shadows was watching, waiting to pounce.</p>
