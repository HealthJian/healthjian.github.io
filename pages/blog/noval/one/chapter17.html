                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔带着托马斯和迈克出了警局，直奔海港附近的一家饭店——金港烧烤。这地方是科尔从地图和线索里挑出来的重点嫌疑目标：离南门不到两公里，步行半小时能到，专卖海鲜面和烧烤，高端酒水，商业餐饮齐备，位置隐私，却人流量大，生意火得不行，疑似欠缴税款和高档酒水的购置税，资产所有人身价过亿，餐饮、房地产、物流，尤其是海运都有涉猎。他手里攥着那张从尸体兜里掏出的烧焦纸条，上面模糊的"K…R…S"在他脑子里转了好几圈，越看越像这家饭店老板的名字缩写——卡尔·罗森（Karl R Sen）。科尔皱着眉，低声对托马斯说："这地方太巧了，饭店、时间、纸条，都对得上。"迈克啃着口香糖，哼了一声："希望别又是白跑一趟。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole took Thomas and Mike out of the police station, heading straight to a restaurant near the harbor - Golden Harbor BBQ. This place was highlighted by Cole from maps and clues as a key suspect target: less than two kilometers from the South Gate, a half-hour walk away, specializing in seafood noodles and barbecue, high-end liquor, fully equipped for commercial dining, private location, yet high foot traffic, business booming, suspected of unpaid taxes and luxury alcohol purchase tax, with asset owner worth over 100 million, involved in catering, real estate, logistics, especially shipping. He clutched the burned note taken from the victim's pocket, the blurry "K...R...S" spinning in his head several times, increasingly resembling the initials of this restaurant owner's name - Karl Rosen (Karl R Sen). Cole frowned, saying quietly to Thomas: "This place is too coincidental, the restaurant, the time, the note, all match up." Mike, chewing gum, snorted: "Hope it's not another wild goose chase."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">三人推门走进金港烧烤，店里热气腾腾，海鲜面的香味混着烤肉的香味扑鼻而来。老板卡尔·罗森坐在海景沙发上，五十多岁，看起来身材微胖，穿着件西装，一幅精英打扮，手里拿着一杯威士忌，旁边站着个高大的保镖，眼神冷得像块冰。卡尔抬头看了眼三个警员，嘴角一扯，露出个狡猾又诙谐的笑："哟，先生们，这么大阵仗，是来吃饭还是？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The three pushed open the door and entered Golden Harbor BBQ, where the air was steamy, with the aroma of seafood noodles mixed with the smell of grilled meat wafting toward them. Owner Karl Rosen sat on an ocean-view sofa, in his fifties, looking slightly plump, wearing a suit, dressed like an elite, holding a glass of whiskey, with a tall bodyguard standing beside him, his eyes as cold as ice. Karl looked up at the three officers, his mouth curling into a sly yet humorous smile: "Well, gentlemen, such a big show, are you here to eat or what?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔没废话，直接亮出警徽："卡尔·罗森，我们在调查昨晚海港附近的案子。有证据显示，嫌疑人死前吃过海鲜，地点可能就在你这儿。"他顿了顿，盯着卡尔的眼睛，"昨晚九点到十一点，你店里有没有什么可疑的人？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole didn't waste words, directly showing his badge: "Karl Rosen, we're investigating a case near the harbor last night. Evidence suggests the suspect ate seafood before dying, possibly at your place." He paused, staring into Karl's eyes, "Between nine and eleven last night, were there any suspicious people in your restaurant?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">卡尔放下酒杯，靠在椅背上，笑得更开了："警官，你这问题问得我头晕。这里每天人多得跟沙丁鱼似的，我哪记得谁是谁？再说，你们警局没管好嘴，搞得满城都知道海鲜的事儿，我的生意都快黄了！"他语气犀利，带着点不屑，"要我说，你们该先管管自己，别来我这儿找麻烦。"说完他瞥了眼保镖，那家伙往前迈了半步，挡在卡尔身前。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Karl put down his glass, leaned back in his chair, smiling even more broadly: "Officer, your question makes me dizzy. This place is packed like sardines every day, how would I remember who is who? Besides, your police station hasn't kept its mouth shut, making the whole city know about the seafood issue, my business is almost ruined!" His tone was sharp, with a touch of disdain, "If you ask me, you should manage yourselves first, don't come here to cause trouble." After speaking, he glanced at the bodyguard, who stepped forward half a step, blocking in front of Karl.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔皱了皱眉，没被他绕进去："少废话，我们有权检查你的监控和账单。配合点，别逼我申请搜查令。"卡尔哼笑一声，摆摆手："查吧查吧，反正我清清白白。这店只是我玩票儿的买卖，真当我靠这个吃饭？"他语气里透着股大背景的底气，显然不把这几个警员放眼里。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole frowned, not letting himself be sidetracked: "Cut the nonsense, we have the right to check your surveillance and bills. Cooperate, don't force me to apply for a search warrant." Karl snorted a laugh, waving his hand: "Search away, I'm clean anyway. This restaurant is just a hobby business for me, do you really think I rely on this for a living?" His tone revealed confidence from a powerful background, clearly not taking these few officers seriously.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">托马斯冷着脸去调监控，迈克翻了翻柜台边的账本，科尔站在原地，死死盯着卡尔。卡尔喝了口酒，眯着眼回看，像在掂量这小子的斤两。店里的气氛紧得像拉满的弓，谁也不知道下一秒会崩出什么。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Thomas went to check the surveillance with a cold face, Mike flipped through the account book at the counter, while Cole stood still, staring intently at Karl. Karl took a sip of his drink, squinting back, as if weighing this young man's mettle. The atmosphere in the restaurant was as tense as a fully drawn bow, no one knew what would snap next.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"你就是科尔警督吧？我听说你现在还不到三十岁，就干到了警督，真是春风得意，后身可畏啊。"卡尔走路过来。"我不想说什么，告诉你，那个海港也有我的货，现在他也被烧了，没人在乎赔钱给我，现在满世界还在找我的麻烦。科尔警督，这太不公平了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"You must be Superintendent Cole? I've heard you're not even thirty yet, already made superintendent, truly flourishing, formidable future ahead." Karl walked over. "I don't want to say much, but let me tell you, that harbor also had my goods, now it's been burned down, no one cares about compensating me, and now everyone's looking to give me trouble. Superintendent Cole, this is too unfair."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"只要遵守法律，法律会善待每一个人的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"As long as one follows the law, the law will treat everyone kindly."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"对，说得很好，希望法律能做到。"卡尔轻蔑地回了一句。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Yes, well said, I hope the law can achieve that." Karl replied contemptuously.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">与此同时，我从家里出来，漫无目的地走在街上。左臂的绷带硌得我有点烦，可我还是绕到了安德利牺牲的那条街角。环卫工人正在洗刷地面，那地上还有些许的血迹，像一块抹不去的疤。我站在那儿，脑子里全是他的脸，耳边仿佛又响起那句"这该死的世界"。正发呆时，我听见一声低低的啜泣，转头一看，一个金发女人站在不远处，低头抹着眼泪。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Meanwhile, I left home, walking aimlessly on the street. The bandage on my left arm was chafing me a bit, but I still made my way to the street corner where Andrey had sacrificed himself. Sanitation workers were washing the ground, with traces of blood still visible, like an indelible scar. I stood there, my mind filled with his face, as if hearing again that phrase "this damned world". While lost in thought, I heard a low sob, and turning my head, saw a blonde woman standing not far away, lowering her head and wiping away tears.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她美得让人挪不开眼，金发披在肩上，像阳光洒在海面上，眼睛红红的，带着股让人心疼的脆弱。我愣了下，心跳莫名快了一拍，可职业习惯让我走了过去，低声问："女士，你没事吧？发生什么事了？"她抬头看了我一眼，眼里闪过一丝慌乱，摇了摇头，声音细得像蚊子："没事……我只是路过。"她明显在隐瞒什么，可那张脸却让我有种说不上来的感觉，像是一见钟情，又像是某种直觉在敲门。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">She was stunningly beautiful, with golden hair cascading over her shoulders like sunlight spreading across the sea, her eyes red, carrying a vulnerability that tugged at one's heartstrings. I was stunned, my heart inexplicably skipping a beat, but professional habit made me walk over and ask softly: "Ma'am, are you alright? What happened?" She looked up at me, a flash of panic in her eyes, shook her head, her voice as thin as a mosquito's: "Nothing... I was just passing by." She was clearly hiding something, but that face gave me an indescribable feeling, like love at first sight, yet also like some intuition knocking.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"你认识这儿的人吗？"我试着再问一句，指了指地上的血迹。她咬了咬唇，眼泪又掉下来，可还是没说话，转身就要走。我想叫住她，可手机响了，是局里的号码。我犹豫了下，接起电话，她趁机快步离开，消失在街角。我盯着她的背影，心里乱糟糟的，既是失落，又是种莫名的牵挂。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Do you know someone from here?" I tried asking again, pointing at the bloodstains on the ground. She bit her lip, tears falling again, but still didn't speak, turning to leave. I wanted to stop her, but my phone rang, it was the station's number. I hesitated, answered the call, and she took the opportunity to quickly leave, disappearing around the corner. I stared at her retreating figure, my heart a jumble, feeling both loss and an inexplicable concern.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">电话那头是托马斯的声音："卢卡斯，你在哪儿？我们在金港烧烤，科尔怀疑这儿有猫腻。你伤怎么样，能不能过来？"我低声回了句："我没事，马上到。"挂了电话，我最后看了眼那片血迹，转身往金港烧烤赶。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Thomas's voice came from the other end of the phone: "Lucas, where are you? We're at Golden Harbor BBQ, Cole suspects something fishy here. How's your injury, can you come over?" I quietly replied: "I'm fine, be right there." Hanging up, I took one last look at the bloodstain, then turned and hurried towards Golden Harbor BBQ.</p>
