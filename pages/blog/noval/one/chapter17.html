                    <p class="zh-content">科尔让我一起去调查一家叫"金港烧烤"的饭馆，说是死者最后吃饭的地方，有可能是案件的重要线索。托马斯开车，他坐副驾，迈克和我在后排。车里气氛沉闷，科尔一路沉默，车开到东区码头附近的商业街，一栋两层的红砖楼前停下。金港烧烤的招牌在二楼亮着，大红的底色，金黄的字体，看着很气派。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole asked me to join the investigation of a restaurant called "Golden Harbor BBQ," saying it was where the deceased had his last meal, and could be an important clue in the case. Thomas drove, with him in the passenger seat, Mike and I in the back. The atmosphere in the car was gloomy, with Cole silent all the way, until the car stopped in front of a two-story red brick building near the East Dock commercial street. The sign for Golden Harbor BBQ was lit up on the second floor, with a deep red background and golden yellow font, looking quite impressive.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">进门时，我注意到店门口站着两个大块头，西装革履，耳朵里塞着通讯器，明显是保镖。店里装修考究，中式的屏风、雕花灯具和现代简约的桌椅混搭，看着不违和，反而有种精致的感觉。我下意识地扫视了一圈，店里客人不多，多是附近的商人和白领，氛围很舒适。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">As we entered, I noticed two burly men standing at the entrance, dressed in suits with communication devices in their ears, clearly bodyguards. The interior of the restaurant was exquisitely decorated, with a mix of Chinese screens, carved light fixtures and modern minimalist tables and chairs, which didn't clash but rather created a sense of refinement. I instinctively scanned the place, there weren't many customers, mostly nearby businessmen and white-collar workers, and the atmosphere was comfortable.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔直接走向吧台，亮出警徽："梅罗德警局，我们有几个问题要问。"吧台后的调酒师礼貌点头，说："我去叫经理。"不一会儿，从里间走出一个微胖的中年男人，穿着高档西装，头发梳得一丝不苟，笑容亲切却又带着距离感："几位警官好，我是这里的老板卡尔·罗森，有什么能帮到你们的？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole walked directly to the bar, flashing his badge: "Melrod Police Department, we have a few questions to ask." The bartender behind the counter nodded politely, saying: "I'll call the manager." Shortly after, a slightly overweight middle-aged man emerged from the back room, wearing an expensive suit, his hair meticulously combed, with a smile that was friendly yet distant: "Hello, officers, I'm the owner here, Karl Rosen, what can I help you with?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔直奔主题："卡尔先生，我们调查到，一位名叫洛伦佐·贝尔的男子在被杀前曾在你这里用餐，我们需要了解一下他当晚的情况。"卡尔听到这名字，眉头微皱，好像在回忆："洛伦佐？抱歉，我不太记得这个名字了，我们这里客人很多。"他偏头看了一眼站在门口的保镖，眼神闪动了一下。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole went straight to the point: "Mr. Rosen, we've determined that a man named Lorenzo Bell dined here before he was killed, and we need to understand his situation that night." When Karl heard the name, his brow furrowed slightly, as if trying to recall: "Lorenzo? Sorry, I don't quite remember that name, we have many guests here." He tilted his head to glance at the bodyguards standing at the entrance, his eyes flickering momentarily.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">托马斯拿出死者的照片："这个人，前天晚上在你店里吃饭，点了深海鳕鱼配松露汁和黑珍珠海参汤，这些可是你们店的招牌菜，据说只有贵宾才能享用。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Thomas took out a photo of the deceased: "This man, he dined in your restaurant the night before last, ordered deep-sea cod with truffle sauce and black pearl sea cucumber soup, which are your signature dishes, supposedly only available to VIP guests."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">卡尔看了照片，表情不变："哦，这位先生啊。我想起来了，他确实来过，普通客人，没什么特别的。至于菜品，如果愿意付钱，谁都能点。"他的语气轻描淡写，好像只是谈论天气。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Karl looked at the photo, his expression unchanged: "Oh, this gentleman. I remember now, he did come, a regular customer, nothing special. As for the dishes, anyone who's willing to pay can order them." His tone was dismissive, as if just discussing the weather.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔眯起眼："卡尔先生，根据我们的情报，你的金港烧烤不仅仅是间餐厅，对吧？我们想了解洛伦佐与你有什么交易。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole narrowed his eyes: "Mr. Rosen, according to our intelligence, your Golden Harbor BBQ is not just a restaurant, right? We want to know what kind of deal Lorenzo had with you."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">卡尔的笑容冷了几分："科尔警官，你在暗示什么？我只是个正经商人，开个饭店而已。如果你有什么指控，最好拿出证据。否则，这就是诽谤。"他顿了顿，从内口袋掏出名片夹，抽出一张："这是我律师的联系方式，有什么问题可以通过他联系我。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Karl's smile cooled a few degrees: "Officer Cole, what are you insinuating? I'm just a legitimate businessman, just running a restaurant. If you have any accusations, you'd better produce evidence. Otherwise, this is slander." He paused, took out a card case from his inner pocket, and extracted a card: "This is my lawyer's contact information, if you have any questions, you can contact me through him."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">就在气氛变得紧张时，一个年轻女服务员端着托盘从后厨出来，我不经意抬头，与她四目相对。那一刻，我愣住了。她金色的长发扎成马尾，碧蓝的眼睛像深海，皮肤白皙，五官精致得像精心雕琢的艺术品。她应该是个混血儿，带着东欧的轮廓和东方的细腻。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just as the atmosphere was becoming tense, a young female waitress came out from the kitchen carrying a tray, I casually looked up and our eyes met. At that moment, I was stunned. Her golden long hair was tied in a ponytail, her azure eyes like the deep sea, her skin fair, and her features as delicate as carefully crafted artwork. She should be of mixed blood, with Eastern European contours and Oriental delicacy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她看到我们，明显惊了一下，托盘微微晃动，差点打翻酒杯。卡尔注意到了，冲她皱眉："艾琳，小心点。"他的语气不像对员工，更像对亲人。女孩快速整理情绪，微微点头，把托盘放到客人桌上，然后匆匆走开。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When she saw us, she was visibly startled, the tray wobbling slightly, almost knocking over the glasses. Karl noticed, frowned at her: "Erin, be careful." His tone wasn't like speaking to an employee, but more like to a family member. The girl quickly composed herself, nodded slightly, placed the tray on the customer's table, then hurried away.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我目送她离开，不由自主地想跟上去，却被科尔的声音拉回现实："卡尔先生，我们需要检查你店里的监控记录和账目，特别是洛伦佐用餐那天的。"卡尔摊手："当然，合法搜查我自然配合。托马斯，把账本和监控录像调出来。"他对着一个年长的经理使了个眼色。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I watched her leave, unconsciously wanting to follow, but was pulled back to reality by Cole's voice: "Mr. Rosen, we need to check your surveillance records and accounts, especially from the day Lorenzo dined." Karl spread his hands: "Of course, I'll cooperate with a legal search. Thomas, bring out the account books and surveillance footage." He gave an older manager a meaningful look.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔让托马斯和迈克去查监控和账本，自己继续和卡尔谈话。我趁机往厨房方向走，想找那个叫艾琳的女孩。厨房入口处，一个保镖拦住我："先生，后厨区域不对外开放。"我亮出警徽："警方调查。"他皱眉，刚想说什么，艾琳从里面走出来，手里拿着一个托盘。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole instructed Thomas and Mike to check the surveillance and accounts, while he continued talking with Karl. I took the opportunity to walk towards the kitchen, hoping to find the girl called Erin. At the kitchen entrance, a bodyguard stopped me: "Sir, the back kitchen area is not open to the public." I flashed my badge: "Police investigation." He frowned, was about to say something when Erin walked out from inside, holding a tray.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她看到我，停住脚步，眼神中闪过惊慌。我上前一步："你好，能谈几句吗？"她紧张地看了一眼卡尔，见他正被科尔缠住，才低声回答："我不知道什么。"她的中文带着轻微的口音，声音柔软。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">She saw me, stopped in her tracks, with panic flashing in her eyes. I stepped forward: "Hello, can we talk for a moment?" She nervously glanced at Karl, seeing that he was preoccupied with Cole, then replied in a low voice: "I don't know anything." Her Chinese had a slight accent, her voice soft.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"我只是想问问，你认识洛伦佐吗？他前天晚上来这吃饭的那个客人。"我尽量让自己的语气温和，不想吓到她。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"I just want to ask, do you know Lorenzo? The customer who came here for dinner the night before last." I tried to make my tone as gentle as possible, not wanting to scare her.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她犹豫了一下，眼神飘向一边："记得，他点了鳕鱼和海参汤。"她的手微微发抖，托盘上的餐具发出细微的碰撞声。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">She hesitated, her gaze drifting to one side: "I remember, he ordered cod and sea cucumber soup." Her hand trembled slightly, causing the cutlery on the tray to emit faint collision sounds.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"他和卡尔谈过话吗？或者见了什么人？"我追问。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Did he talk to Karl? Or meet anyone?" I pressed.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她眼中闪过一丝痛苦："我真的不知道。你快走吧，被看到了不好。"她急促地说完，想要绕过我。我伸手想拦她，不小心碰到她的手臂，她像触电般瑟缩了一下，托盘倾斜，一个酒杯摔在地上，碎成几片。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">A flash of pain crossed her eyes: "I really don't know. You should go quickly, it's not good to be seen." She spoke hurriedly, trying to move past me. I reached out to stop her, accidentally touching her arm, and she shrank back as if electrocuted, the tray tilting, a glass falling to the ground, shattering into several pieces.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">声响引来了卡尔的注意。他转过头，看到我和艾琳站在一起，表情顿时阴沉下来。他大步走过来："艾琳，怎么回事？"他的语气温和，眼神却冰冷刺骨。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The noise drew Karl's attention. He turned his head, saw me standing with Erin, and his expression immediately darkened. He strode over: "Erin, what's going on?" His tone was gentle, but his eyes were ice-cold.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">艾琳低着头，声音几乎听不见："对不起，我不小心打碎了杯子。"卡尔拍了拍她的肩膀："没关系，去后面休息吧。"语气突然变得出奇的温柔。艾琳如蒙大赦，迅速离开，临走前给了我一个复杂的眼神，像是警告，又像是请求。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Erin lowered her head, her voice barely audible: "I'm sorry, I accidentally broke a glass." Karl patted her shoulder: "It's okay, go rest in the back." His tone suddenly became extraordinarily gentle. Erin, as if granted a great pardon, quickly left, giving me a complex look before she went, like a warning, yet also like a plea.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">卡尔转向我，笑容不达眼底："警官，这里是厨房区域，为了卫生安全，还请不要乱走动。"他的眼神像刀子，在我脸上扫过，仿佛在说：别碰不该碰的东西。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Karl turned to me, his smile not reaching his eyes: "Officer, this is the kitchen area, for hygiene and safety reasons, please don't wander around." His gaze was like a knife, sweeping across my face, as if saying: don't touch things you shouldn't.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我装作无所谓地耸耸肩："抱歉，我只是想找洗手间。"卡尔指了指走廊尽头："那边右转。"他的语气恢复了平静，却让人感到更加危险。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I shrugged as if it didn't matter: "Sorry, I was just looking for the restroom." Karl pointed to the end of the corridor: "Turn right there." His tone had regained its calmness, yet it made one feel even more dangerous.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">回到大厅，科尔正在和托马斯、迈克汇合。托马斯摇头："监控系统昨晚'坏了'，关键时段全是雪花。"迈克也无奈："账本干净得像模范企业，找不出一点问题。"科尔眉头紧锁，低声咒骂了一句，然后对卡尔说："卡尔先生，谢谢配合，如果有新情况，我们还会再来。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Back in the hall, Cole was meeting with Thomas and Mike. Thomas shook his head: "The surveillance system 'broke down' last night, the crucial period is all static." Mike also helplessly said: "The account books are as clean as a model enterprise, can't find a single issue." Cole's brow furrowed deeply, he cursed under his breath, then said to Karl: "Mr. Rosen, thank you for your cooperation, if there are any new developments, we'll be back."</p>

                    <p class="zh-content">离开金港烧烤，我向科尔报告了和艾琳的对话，他思索了一下："这女孩是个突破口，她知道些什么，但害怕卡尔。得想办法单独和她谈谈。"我点点头，脑海中浮现艾琳惊慌的眼神和卡尔冰冷的笑容。这对搭档怎么看都不对劲，金发女孩和肥胖餐厅老板，一个胆怯如鹿，一个凶狠如狼。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Leaving Golden Harbor BBQ, I reported my conversation with Erin to Cole, who thought for a moment: "This girl is a breakthrough point, she knows something, but is afraid of Karl. Need to find a way to talk to her alone." I nodded, with Erin's panicked eyes and Karl's cold smile floating in my mind. This duo didn't seem right no matter how you looked at it, a blonde girl and an obese restaurant owner, one as timid as a deer, the other as fierce as a wolf.</p>

                    <p class="zh-content">回到车里，我靠在窗边，思绪飘回安德利死去的那个街角。艾琳湛蓝的眼睛和安德利鲜血的红色在我脑中交织，一种莫名的直觉告诉我，这个看似柔弱的金发女孩，可能是整个案件的关键。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Back in the car, I leaned against the window, my thoughts drifting back to the street corner where Andrey died. Erin's deep blue eyes and Andrey's red blood intertwined in my mind, and an inexplicable intuition told me that this seemingly fragile blonde girl might be the key to the entire case.</p>
