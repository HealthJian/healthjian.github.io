            <div class="novel-text">
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我脑子里乱成一团，欧文死前那句"文森比尔"像把刀刻在心上。特勤队没杀我和梅尔，显然是没接到命令，可谁知道我和欧文的事儿？答案明摆着——科尔！我猛踩油门，低声对梅尔吼："去保护艾琳，他们要清算知情者了！"梅尔手抖得厉害，烟掉在地上，可还是点点头，开车往旅店方向冲。我独自驾车直奔科尔家，路上拨他电话，占线，心里那股不祥的预感越来越重。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">My mind was in chaos, with Owen's last words "Vincent Bill" etched in my heart like a knife. The special ops team didn't kill Mel and me, obviously because they hadn't received orders, but who knew about Owen and me? The answer was obvious—Cole! I floored the accelerator, growling to Mel in a low voice: "Go protect Erin, they're eliminating everyone who knows!" Mel's hands shook badly, his cigarette falling to the ground, but he still nodded and drove towards the hotel. I drove alone straight to Cole's house, dialing his number on the way, but the line was busy. The ominous feeling in my gut grew stronger.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">到科尔家时，天已经黑透了，小区静得像坟场。我敲门，手心全是汗，低声喊："科尔，开门！"门吱呀一声开了，科尔站在那儿，眼圈黑得像熊猫，头发乱糟糟的，显然刚睡醒。他揉着眼问："卢卡斯，明天正准备找你，什么事？"我喘着气，低声说："欧文死了，他说文森比尔！文森比尔是他妈谁？"科尔愣了半秒，眼底闪过震惊，随即冷静下来，低声说："文森比尔是我的父亲，前警长，我知道是谁了，我早该猜到这老狐狸！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">By the time I reached Cole's house, the sky had darkened completely, and the neighborhood was as quiet as a cemetery. I knocked on the door, my palms sweaty, calling out softly: "Cole, open up!" The door creaked open, and Cole stood there, with dark circles like a panda's around his eyes and messy hair—clearly just woken up. Rubbing his eyes, he asked: "Lucas, I was planning to find you tomorrow, what's up?" Panting, I said quietly: "Owen's dead. He mentioned Vincent Bill! Who the hell is Vincent Bill?" Cole froze for half a second, shock flashing across his eyes before he regained his composure and said in a low voice: "Vincent Bill is my father, the former police chief. I know who it is now. I should have guessed that old fox!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">话音刚落，远处传来引擎声，几辆黑色轿车冲进小区，车灯晃得人睁不开眼。我低骂："来了，要收咱们！"我冲回车里，从后备箱拖出一箱子弹和武器：三把步枪、一把霰弹枪、两把手枪，还有两件防弹衣。科尔跑进屋，拎出三把手枪和五盒子弹扔桌上，低声说："死也要死在战斗里！"我扔给他一件防弹衣，他接过来穿上，眼里燃起股狠劲。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">As he finished speaking, the sound of engines came from the distance, and several black sedans rushed into the neighborhood, their headlights so bright they hurt our eyes. I cursed under my breath: "They're here, coming for us!" I rushed back to my car and dragged out a box of ammunition and weapons: three rifles, a shotgun, two handguns, and two bulletproof vests. Cole ran into the house and brought out three handguns and five boxes of bullets, tossing them on the table, saying quietly: "If we die, we die fighting!" I threw him a bulletproof vest, which he caught and put on, a fierce determination igniting in his eyes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">就在这时，啪的一声，屋里断电了，整栋楼陷入一片漆黑。窗外脚步声密集，像群狼围了过来。我低声对科尔说："他们上来了！"科尔没等对面靠近楼梯，端起步枪靠着窗口，借着月光瞄准楼下，一枪崩出去，正中一个黑影的脑袋。那家伙闷哼一声栽倒，鲜血溅了一地。枪声炸响，战斗彻底打开了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just then, with a snap, the house lost power, and the entire building plunged into darkness. Dense footsteps echoed outside the window, like a pack of wolves closing in. I whispered to Cole: "They're coming up!" Cole didn't wait for them to reach the stairs; he picked up a rifle, leaned against the window, and using the moonlight to aim, fired a shot that hit one of the shadowy figures right in the head. The man fell with a muffled groan, blood splattering everywhere. The gunshot echoed, and the battle was fully joined.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">楼下十个黑衣人散开，有的冲楼梯，有的找掩体，子弹像雨点砸上来，打得墙皮乱飞。我和科尔蹲在门口两侧，我端着步枪扫射，一枪干掉一个刚探头的家伙，脑浆喷得满墙。科尔冷静得吓人，一枪一个，肩膀却冷不丁中了一发，血顺着胳膊淌下来。他咬牙低骂："操，没事！"我喊："撑住！"可对方火力太猛，子弹打得门框木屑乱溅。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Below, ten men in black spread out, some charging up the stairs, others finding cover. Bullets rained down like hailstones, causing plaster to fly from the walls. Cole and I crouched on either side of the doorway. I sprayed fire with my rifle, taking down a man who had just peeked his head out, his brains splattering the wall. Cole was frighteningly calm, picking them off one by one, but a bullet suddenly hit his shoulder, blood streaming down his arm. He gritted his teeth and cursed: "Fuck, I'm fine!" I shouted: "Hang in there!" But the enemy's firepower was too intense, bullets making the door frame splinter.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我瞅准机会，抓起霰弹枪滚进地下室楼梯，低声喊："科尔，掩护我！"他靠着墙还击，我猫着腰下到地下室，借着黑暗埋伏在楼梯口。一个黑衣人摸下来，我屏住呼吸，等他靠近，霰弹枪一轰，近距离崩了他半个胸膛，血肉模糊。接着又是两个冲下来，我端着步枪连开两枪，一个爆头，一个胸口中弹，倒地抽了几下不动了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Seizing an opportunity, I grabbed the shotgun and rolled into the basement stairway, calling out quietly: "Cole, cover me!" He returned fire from against the wall as I crouched my way down to the basement, using the darkness to ambush at the foot of the stairs. A man in black crept down, and I held my breath, waiting until he was close before firing the shotgun, blasting away half his chest at close range, leaving a bloody mess. Then two more charged down; I fired my rifle twice in quick succession, one shot to the head and one to the chest, and they fell to the ground, twitched a few times, and then lay still.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">楼上枪声没停，我冲回地面，见科尔靠着墙喘气，肩膀血流得更凶。我低吼："下去，我掩护！"他点点头，我端起步枪扫射，又干掉两个从窗口爬进来的家伙。第六个黑衣人从后门摸进来，我听到脚步声，转身一枪，正中他咽喉，血喷了我一脸。房间进入了死寂，我喘着粗气，以为已经杀光了所有人。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Gunfire hadn't ceased upstairs. I rushed back to the ground floor to find Cole leaning against the wall, gasping for breath, the blood flowing more profusely from his shoulder. I growled: "Get down, I'll cover you!" He nodded, and I raised my rifle, spraying bullets and taking out two more men who were climbing in through the window. A sixth man in black sneaked in through the back door; I heard his footsteps, turned, and shot him in the throat, his blood spraying my face. The room fell into a deathly silence, and I panted heavily, thinking we had killed all of them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"伤势怎么样？"我扶起科尔，他疼得龇牙咧嘴，刚要说话，门口脚步声响起，莱门斯走了进来，西装笔挺，手里握着枪，冷冷地看着我们。他没废话，对着科尔就是一枪，我猛地推开他，子弹穿过我左肩钻进墙里，疼得我闷哼一声。肾上腺素飙升，我红着眼扑向莱门斯，他抬手又是一枪，正中我胸口，防弹衣没挡住打进了肉里，冲击力像锤子砸下来，我腿一软，像踩了棉花倒在地上，大口喘气。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"How's your wound?" I helped Cole up; he was grimacing in pain and was about to speak when footsteps sounded at the door. Lemons walked in, immaculately dressed in a suit, a gun in his hand, looking at us coldly. Without wasting words, he fired a shot at Cole. I pushed him aside roughly; the bullet passed through my left shoulder and into the wall, causing me to groan in pain. My adrenaline surged, and I lunged at Lemons with bloodshot eyes. He raised his hand and fired again, hitting me in the chest. The bulletproof vest failed to stop it, and the bullet penetrated my flesh. The impact felt like a hammer blow; my legs gave way, and I fell to the ground as if I'd stepped on cotton, gasping for air.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯走过来，对着科尔肩膀补了一枪，科尔闷哼倒地。莱门斯低声说："真不愧是文森比尔的儿子。"我喘不上气，眼看他要下死手，凭着一股意志抓起地上的手枪，对着他小腿就是一枪。他"啊"的一声栽倒，手枪脱手。我挣扎着爬起来，他却又掏出一把备用枪，对着我头开了一枪。我眼前一黑，意识瞬间模糊，倒在地上没了力气。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons walked over and fired another shot into Cole's shoulder, causing him to groan and fall to the ground. Lemons said quietly: "Truly worthy of being Vincent Bill's son." I couldn't catch my breath, and seeing he was about to finish us off, I mustered my will and grabbed a handgun from the ground, shooting him in the leg. He fell with a cry of pain, dropping his gun. As I struggled to get up, he pulled out a backup gun and fired a shot at my head. Everything went black, my consciousness instantly blurred, and I collapsed to the ground with no strength left.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">就在我以为完了的瞬间，科尔咬牙爬起来，抓起霰弹枪指向莱门斯。莱门斯愣了下，扔掉枪，举起手，笑着低声说："年轻人，何必呢？我快退休了，你离我的位置就差一步，你不就是想证明你比你的父亲还要优秀吗？等我回去，跟上面说几句好话，你的位置就是稳的。"科尔喘着粗气，枪口没挪开，沉默了一会儿，低声说："请你说到做到。"莱门斯点点头，眼底闪过一丝狡光。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just when I thought it was over, Cole gritted his teeth and got up, grabbing the shotgun and aiming it at Lemons. Lemons hesitated, dropped his gun, and raised his hands, smiling as he said softly: "Young man, why bother? I'm about to retire, and you're just one step away from my position. Don't you want to prove that you're better than your father? When I go back, I'll put in a good word for you with the higher-ups, and your position will be secure." Cole was breathing heavily, not moving the gun barrel away. After a moment of silence, he said quietly: "Make sure you keep your word." Lemons nodded, a cunning gleam flashing in his eyes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">黑暗中，血腥味儿弥漫，我躺在地上，意识模糊，只剩耳边科尔的喘息和莱门斯的冷笑。这该死的世界，真他妈烂透了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">In the darkness, the smell of blood filled the air. I lay on the ground, my consciousness hazy, with only Cole's heavy breathing and Lemons' cold laughter in my ears. This damned world was truly rotten to the core.</p>
