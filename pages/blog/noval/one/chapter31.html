                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文打算去找我的，但是他正在特勤局的办公室里翻看马丁的"猛料"看的着迷。现在他确信，检察官深陷"淫乱案"丑闻并非虚构而是确有其事，马丁可能做梦也没有意料到，欧文不仅翻开了红色的箱子检查了照片，还一股打包了所有的证据，真是个蠢货。欧文现在明白了一切，莱门斯！勃利德！莱门斯手下的一些黑警，他们是一伙的！里面的人肯定还远不止这些。莱门斯策划了这次苦肉计，想把脏水泼到卢卡斯的身上，勃利德和一些议员被马丁拍下了嫖娼的照片因此被莱门斯常年威胁，马丁因为假新闻和贪污报社经费被莱门斯威胁，还有卢卡斯和艾琳的偷拍照……等等，是安德烈和几个警察的合影，他们手里拿着海洛因，操，这帮黑警……最操蛋的是，自己的老大鲍里斯也深陷其中，他也参与了其中的所有活动，甚至有的以安全局之名……环环相扣，这帮蛀虫！</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen had planned to find me, but he was engrossed in reviewing Martin's "bombshell" in the Special Operations Bureau office. Now he was certain that the prosecutor's involvement in the "sex scandal" was not fabricated but real. Martin probably never dreamed that Owen would not only open the red box to examine the photos but also bundle all the evidence together—what a fool. Owen now understood everything: Lemons! Bolide! Some corrupt cops under Lemons—they were all in this together! There must be far more people involved than just these. Lemons had planned this frame-up, wanting to smear Lucas. Bolide and some congressmen had been blackmailed by Lemons for years after Martin photographed them with prostitutes. Martin was being threatened over fake news and embezzling newspaper funds. Then there were the stolen photos of Lucas and Erin... Wait, here was Andre with several police officers, holding heroin. Damn, these corrupt cops... The worst part was that his own boss, Boris, was deeply involved; he had participated in all these activities, some even in the name of the Security Bureau... It was all interconnected—these parasites!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文接到维克托被杀的消息时，电话那头传来同事低沉的声音："维克托昨晚死了，滨海公园，枪伤。"欧文愣了半秒，手里的文件哗啦掉在地上，震惊得像被雷劈中。他低声骂了句："操，怎么会这样？"没多想，他抓起手机拨给科尔，可那边占线。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When Owen received the news of Victor's murder, his colleague's somber voice came through the phone: "Victor died last night, Coastal Park, gunshot wound." Owen froze for half a second, the documents in his hand falling to the floor with a rustle, shocked as if struck by lightning. He cursed under his breath: "Fuck, how could this happen?" Without much thought, he grabbed his phone and dialed Cole, but the line was busy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">这时鲍里斯走了进来，一个六十多岁的中等个子的人，眼神深邃的吓人。欧文吓了一跳，手悄悄从配枪移动，这时又进来三个警卫，鲍里斯对着欧文说道："欧文，港口那边有新的进展，一线需要你过去！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">At that moment, Boris walked in—a medium-built man in his sixties with frighteningly deep eyes. Owen startled, his hand quietly moving away from his gun as three more guards entered. Boris addressed Owen: "Owen, there's new development at the port; they need you on the front line!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文知道不能硬来，说道："是的，长官！"于是简单假装收拾东西，将最重要的东西带在身上，并用电脑给科尔将所有的资料传真过去。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen knew he couldn't force his way out, so he said, "Yes, sir!" He then pretended to gather his things, taking the most important items with him, and using the computer to fax all the materials to Cole.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">马不停蹄，欧文几乎一路小跑，在鲍里斯等人的注视下上了车。车开到半路，夜色浓得像墨，一道闪光灯，一辆特勤局的黑色SUV突然从侧巷冲出来，横在路中央，拦住去路。欧文猛踩刹车，车胎吱吱作响，他还没来得及反应，后方又一辆SUV堵住退路。前后夹击，像是早设好的局。他心跳猛地加速，手伸向腰间掏出配枪，低声嘀咕："这他妈是冲我来的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Moving quickly, Owen almost jogged the whole way, getting into his car under the watchful eyes of Boris and the others. Halfway through the drive, in the ink-like darkness of night, a flash of light appeared as a black SUV from the Special Operations Bureau suddenly rushed out from a side alley, blocking the road. Owen slammed on the brakes, tires screeching. Before he could react, another SUV blocked his retreat from behind. Trapped from both directions, it seemed like a pre-arranged ambush. His heart rate suddenly accelerated as his hand reached for his sidearm, muttering under his breath: "This is fucking aimed at me."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">没等他多想，对面车窗降下，枪口探出来，"砰砰"几声，子弹擦着车身飞过。欧文一脚踹开车门滚出去，躲在车后还击，枪声脆得像鞭炮，夜空被火光撕开。他一枪崩了对面车胎，SUV歪了一下，可还没喘口气，侧面轰隆一声，一辆装甲车咆哮着冲过来，狠狠撞上他的车。车身翻滚两圈，砸在地上，玻璃碎片四溅。欧文被甩在路边，右腿压在车下，疼得咬牙，血从额头淌下来。他喘着粗气，低骂："今天完了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Before he could think further, the window across from him lowered, and gun barrels emerged. "Bang, bang"—several shots rang out, bullets whizzing past the car body. Owen kicked open the car door and rolled out, taking cover behind the car to return fire. The gunshots cracked like firecrackers, tearing open the night sky with flashes. He shot out one of the SUV's tires, causing it to tilt slightly, but before he could catch his breath, there was a thunderous crash from the side as an armored vehicle roared toward him, violently smashing into his car. The vehicle rolled twice before crashing to the ground, glass fragments flying everywhere. Owen was thrown to the roadside, his right leg trapped under the car, pain shooting through him as he gritted his teeth, blood streaming from his forehead. Gasping for breath, he cursed, "It's over today."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">特勤队员跳下车，黑衣蒙面，端着枪围过来。欧文挣扎着想爬起来，可腿动不了，眼睁睁看着一个家伙举枪对准他脑门。就在这时，不远处传来警笛声，我和梅尔·格林正在附近巡逻，听到撞击声赶了过来。我一眼认出欧文的车，心猛地一沉，打开警灯和鸣笛，低吼："是欧文！"我从车窗探出身子，举枪就射，子弹打得对方一个队员肩膀飙血。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Special ops team members jumped out of their vehicles, dressed in black with masked faces, surrounding him with raised guns. Owen struggled to get up, but his leg wouldn't move. He watched helplessly as one of them aimed a gun at his forehead. Just then, police sirens wailed in the distance—Mel Green and I were patrolling nearby and rushed over after hearing the crash. I immediately recognized Owen's car, my heart sinking. I turned on the police lights and siren, growling, "It's Owen!" Leaning out of the car window, I raised my gun and fired, hitting one of their team members in the shoulder, causing blood to spurt.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">梅尔猛踩油门，巡逻车冲过去，我们跳下来找掩体，跟特勤队员交火。枪声密集得像暴雨，我一枪干掉一个，梅尔手抖得厉害，可还是开了几枪掩护。特勤队员没恋战，其中一个冷冷地看了我们一眼，回头一枪崩了欧文的胸口，点燃了欧文的车，然后跳上车撤了。SUV和装甲车扬长而去，留下一地弹壳和硝烟。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Mel floored the accelerator, and our patrol car charged forward. We jumped out to find cover and exchanged fire with the special ops team. The gunfire was as dense as a downpour. I took down one of them with a shot, and Mel, despite his badly shaking hands, fired several covering shots. The special ops team didn't linger in the fight. One of them gave us a cold glance, then turned back and shot Owen in the chest, set Owen's car on fire, and jumped into their vehicle to retreat. The SUVs and armored vehicle sped away, leaving behind spent shell casings and gunpowder smoke.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我扑到欧文身边，他躺在那儿，胸口血咕嘟咕嘟往外冒，脸色白得像纸。我喊了声："欧文，撑住！"他睁开眼，喘着粗气，抓住我胳膊，用尽全身力气挤出一句："科尔！文森比尔！"说完头一歪，手松开，没了气息。我愣在那儿，脑子嗡嗡作响，梅尔跑过来，低声喊："卢卡斯，他死了！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I rushed to Owen's side. He lay there, blood bubbling from his chest, his face as white as paper. I shouted, "Owen, hang on!" He opened his eyes, gasping for air, grabbing my arm and using all his strength to squeeze out one sentence: "Cole! Vincent Bill!" Then his head tilted to one side, his hand went limp, and he stopped breathing. I stood there stunned, my mind buzzing, as Mel ran over and called out softly: "Lucas, he's dead!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我咬着牙，站起来，低头看着欧文的尸体。血染红了路面，空气里全是火药味儿。梅尔慌得手足无措："这怎么办？特勤队干的？"我没吭声，脑子里全是欧文那句"找科尔"。这该死的世界，果然烂到了骨子里。我抓起对讲机，低声吼："行动组报告，欧文遇袭身亡，请求支援！"可我心里清楚，这支援来了，也救不回这条命。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I gritted my teeth, stood up, and looked down at Owen's body. Blood had stained the road red, and the air was filled with the smell of gunpowder. Mel was panicking: "What do we do? Was it the special ops team?" I remained silent, my mind filled with Owen's words: "Find Cole." This damned world was indeed rotten to the core. I grabbed the radio and growled: "Action team reporting, Owen has been attacked and killed, requesting backup!" But deep down, I knew that even if backup arrived, it couldn't bring back this life.</p>
