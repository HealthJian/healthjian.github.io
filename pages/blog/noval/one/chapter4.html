                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Section 4: Shadows at the Southern Gate</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">三区街头的枪声渐渐稀了下去，支援的警力来得比我预想得快，一群荷枪实弹的家伙冲过来，把那几个混混收拾得干干净净。尸体横七竖八地躺在街角，血混着雨水淌进下水道，看得人胃里翻腾。安德利吐了口唾沫，骂道："这该死的世界，几个废物也敢碰警局，真是活腻了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The gunfire on District Three's streets gradually died down. The reinforcements arrived faster than I had expected—a group of heavily armed guys rushed in and cleaned up those thugs efficiently. Bodies lay haphazardly at the street corner, blood mixing with rainwater flowing into the sewers, turning one's stomach. Andrey spat and cursed: "This damned world, a few worthless punks daring to mess with the police station, they must be tired of living."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我没接话，眯着眼打量现场，总觉得不对劲——这帮家伙装备破烂常在这一带混，警察都知道他们什么尿性，怎么可能干出这么大的动静？分队的兄弟死了两个，伤了四个，这账算不到几个混混头上。周围的警员开始议论，警督喊着要扩大搜索范围，查查附近还有没有漏网之鱼。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I didn't respond, squinting as I surveyed the scene, feeling that something wasn't right—these guys had shabby equipment and usually hung around this area. The police knew what they were capable of, so how could they cause such a commotion? Two of our team brothers were dead and four injured; this couldn't be blamed on just a few thugs. The officers around us started discussing, with the superintendent shouting about expanding the search range to check if there were any escapees in the vicinity.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我和安德利对视一眼，没多说，直接往港口南门摸了过去。街上乱成一团，没人注意我们俩。我想趁乱从南门溜进去，看看能不能找到点线索。港口南门靠着仓库区，平时就不太平，爆炸后更是乌烟瘴气，黑灯瞎火的，连路灯都炸坏了几盏。我们俩贴着墙根走，安德利手里的枪没放下，低声嘀咕："卢卡斯，你说这事会不会跟爆炸有关？太巧了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey and I exchanged a glance, saying nothing more, and headed directly toward the port's southern gate. The streets were in chaos, with no one paying attention to the two of us. I wanted to sneak in through the southern gate during the confusion to see if I could find any clues. The port's southern gate was adjacent to the warehouse district, which was usually not peaceful, and after the explosion, it was even worse—dark and gloomy, with several street lights blown out. We walked along the wall, with Andrey not lowering his gun, muttering softly: "Lucas, do you think this might be related to the explosion? It's too coincidental."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"废话，肯定有关，"我压低声音，"问题是谁干的。混混没这脑子，也没这火力。"我话还没说完，前方黑暗里传来一阵脚步声，低沉但整齐，像训练有素的队伍。我心一紧，拉着安德利蹲进旁边一堆破木箱后面，低声说："别出声，看看情况。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Of course they're related," I lowered my voice, "The question is who did it. These thugs don't have the brains or the firepower for this." Before I finished speaking, the sound of footsteps came from the darkness ahead—low but uniform, like a well-trained team. My heart tightened as I pulled Andrey down behind a pile of broken wooden crates nearby, whispering: "Don't make a sound, let's see what's happening."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">借着远处微弱的火光，我看见一队人影从南门方向撤出来，七八个，全副武装，黑色的皮衣和战术背心，头盔压得低，步履无声，像鬼魂似的。我瞥了眼安德利，小声说："这是不是北区那小子说的安全局的人，或者准确说是安全局的残部。"他点点头，我们俩慢慢站起来，打算过去打个招呼——毕竟是"自己人"，总得搞清楚状况。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">In the dim light from the distant fire, I saw a team of shadows retreating from the direction of the southern gate—seven or eight of them, fully armed, wearing black leather jackets and tactical vests, with helmets pulled low, moving silently like ghosts. I glanced at Andrey and whispered: "Are these the Security Bureau people that the North District guy mentioned, or more precisely, the remnants of the Security Bureau?" He nodded, and we slowly stood up, intending to go over and say hello—after all, they were "our people," and we needed to clarify the situation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我刚张嘴喊了声："嘿，这边是——"话没说完，对面突然一梭子子弹扫过来，带着消声器的"噗噗"声，子弹打在木箱上，木屑四溅。我和安德利吓得魂儿都飞了，赶紧扑倒在地，滚到旁边一辆翻倒的货车后面。我脑子里一片乱麻："自己人"怎么可能不问青红皂白就开枪？安德利喘着粗气，骂道："这该死的世界，连自己人都下黑手！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I had just opened my mouth and called out: "Hey, this is—" before I could finish, a burst of gunfire suddenly came from the other side, with the "puff puff" sound of silencers, bullets hitting the wooden crates and sending splinters flying. Andrey and I were scared out of our wits, quickly dropping to the ground and rolling behind an overturned truck nearby. My mind was in chaos: How could "our own people" open fire without asking any questions? Andrey breathed heavily and cursed: "This damned world, even our own people are turning against us!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我掏出枪还击，朝对面模糊的人影开了两枪，安德利也端起他的手枪，精准地朝黑暗里点射。对面很专业，没吭声也没乱，子弹带消声器的声音让我们根本摸不清他们的位置。我一边开枪一边抓起对讲机吼："南门遇袭！不明武装人员，请求支援，快！"对面似乎听见了我的呼叫，火力猛了一阵，然后突然停了。我探头一看，他们已经退进黑暗，像被夜色吞了一样。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I pulled out my gun and returned fire, shooting twice at the blurry figures opposite, while Andrey also raised his handgun, firing precise bursts into the darkness. The other side was very professional, neither making noise nor becoming disorganized. The silenced gunfire made it impossible for us to pinpoint their positions. While shooting, I grabbed the radio and shouted: "Southern gate under attack! Unidentified armed personnel, requesting backup, hurry!" The other side seemed to hear my call, as the gunfire intensified for a moment, then suddenly stopped. I peeked out and saw they had retreated into the darkness, as if swallowed by the night.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">没两分钟，天上轰隆隆传来直升机的声音，警用探照灯扫下来，把南门照得亮如白昼。我和安德利爬起来，盯着空荡荡的港口，地上只留下一堆弹壳和几个模糊的脚印。支援的警员冲过来，警督跑得满头汗，问："操他妈的，人呢？跑哪儿去了？"我摇摇头，吓坏了，心跳还没平下来，颤颤巍巍地说："鬼知道，消失了，像鬼一样。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Within two minutes, the thunderous sound of a helicopter came from above, with police searchlights sweeping down, illuminating the southern gate as bright as day. Andrey and I got up, staring at the empty port, with only a pile of shell casings and a few blurry footprints left on the ground. The backup officers rushed over, with the superintendent running up, sweating profusely, and asked: "What the fuck, where are they? Where did they go?" I shook my head, still terrified, my heartbeat not yet settled, and said shakily: "Who knows? They vanished, like ghosts."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">安德利点了根烟，吐了个烟圈，眯着眼说："这帮家伙不是安全局的人，也不是咱们的人。装备精良，训练有素，撤得比兔子还快。卢卡斯，这事越来越有意思了。"我没说话，盯着地上的弹壳，心里翻江倒海。梅罗德这破地方，果然没让我失望。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey lit a cigarette, blew a smoke ring, and said with narrowed eyes: "These guys are not from the Security Bureau, nor are they our people. Well-equipped, well-trained, and retreated faster than rabbits. Lucas, this is getting more and more interesting." I didn't respond, staring at the shell casings on the ground, my mind in turmoil. This wretched place called Melrod certainly hadn't disappointed me.</p>
