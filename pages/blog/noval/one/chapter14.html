                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我窝在沙发上，电视屏幕的光晃得眼睛发酸。市长下令戒严海港及附近街区，新闻里滚动播放着武装人员进驻市政大楼的画面。特勤大队的家伙全副武装，端着枪站在大楼门口，像一群黑色的雕塑。屏幕切到警局的新闻发布会，波尔站在台上，脸红得像煮熟的虾，声音里带着股压不住的怒气："这些令人作恶的恐怖行径，简直是对梅罗德市民的挑衅！我们绝不会容忍，一定会彻查到底，把犯罪分子绳之以法！"他攥着拳头砸了下桌子，像是想把这股火撒出去，可那颤抖的手暴露了他的紧张。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I huddled on the sofa, the light from the TV screen making my eyes sore. The mayor had ordered martial law in the harbor and nearby districts, and the news was continuously showing footage of armed personnel entering the city hall. The special task force guys were fully armed, standing at the building entrance with their guns, like a group of black sculptures. The screen cut to the police station's press conference, with Paul standing on the stage, his face as red as a boiled shrimp, his voice carrying an anger he couldn't suppress: "These disgusting acts of terror are simply a provocation against the citizens of Melrod! We will not tolerate it and will thoroughly investigate to bring the criminals to justice!" He clenched his fist and slammed it on the table, as if wanting to vent his anger, but his trembling hand betrayed his nervousness.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯接过话筒，西装笔挺，语气平稳得像在念天气预报："目前案件有了初步进展，南门的雇佣兵和三区的枪击都指向一个有组织的犯罪网络。我们正在全力调查，配合联邦安全局展开行动。"他笑了笑，没多说细节，留下一堆模棱两可的话，像往常一样藏着掖着。记者们在台下举手提问，可他挥挥手就下了台。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons took the microphone, his suit impeccable, his tone as steady as if he were reading a weather forecast: "The case has made initial progress. The mercenaries at the south gate and the shootings in District Three all point to an organized crime network. We are fully investigating and cooperating with the Federal Security Bureau to take action." He smiled, not saying much about the details, leaving a bunch of ambiguous words, hiding things as usual. Reporters raised their hands to ask questions from below the stage, but he waved and left the stage.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">接着是安德利的部分。波尔清了清嗓子，声音低下去："我很遗憾地宣布，警员安德利在昨晚和逃犯的遭遇战中牺牲。他用生命守护了这座城市的安全，捍卫了正义，维护了我们的价值观，我们决定追授他城市英雄勋章，以表彰他的英勇和果敢，他是一位出色的警察和善良的父亲……"屏幕上放出一张安德利的照片，是他几年前拍的证件照，咧着嘴笑得有点傻。我盯着那张脸，手里的遥控器攥得指节发白，眼泪止不住的流。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Then came Andrey's part. Paul cleared his throat, his voice dropping: "I regret to announce that Officer Andrey sacrificed his life in last night's encounter with fugitives. He protected this city's safety with his life, defended justice, upheld our values, and we have decided to posthumously award him the City Hero Medal to commend his bravery and courage. He was an outstanding police officer and a kind father..." The screen showed a photo of Andrey, his ID photo taken a few years ago, smiling with his mouth open, looking a bit silly. I stared at that face, gripping the remote control until my knuckles turned white, tears flowing uncontrollably.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">检察官勃利德走上台，推了推眼镜，摆出一副正气凛然的模样："我们将严查此案，不惜一切代价，绝不姑息任何一人。法律会给市民一个交代！"他语气铿锵，可那双眼睛瞟来瞟去，像在躲谁的目光。紧接着，联邦安全局的代表——一个穿黑制服的干瘦男人——简单说了几句："我们已全面介入调查，每隔一段时间会召开新闻发布会，向公众汇报进展。"说完他就退到一边，没给记者提问的机会。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Prosecutor Breed took the stage, pushed his glasses, and put on a dignified appearance: "We will strictly investigate this case at all costs and will not tolerate anyone. The law will give the citizens an answer!" His tone was firm, but his eyes darted around, as if avoiding someone's gaze. Following him, the representative from the Federal Security Bureau—a thin man in a black uniform—briefly said: "We have fully intervened in the investigation and will hold press conferences periodically to report progress to the public." After speaking, he stepped aside, giving reporters no chance to ask questions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">电视里一片喧哗，我却觉得屋里安静得让人发毛。手机突然响了，我低头一看，是《梅罗德晨报》的号码。对面是个熟悉的声音，报社的编辑马丁，语气急得像热锅上的蚂蚁："卢卡斯，你在哪儿？昨晚的事儿闹大了，读者要猛料！你不是说警局有你的熟人吗？整点劲爆的出来，稿费好说！5万。"我愣了下，喉咙里像堵了块石头。安德利的脸在我脑子里晃，血淋淋地倒在地上，我却在这儿被催着写"猛料"？</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">There was a clamor on the TV, but I felt the house was eerily quiet. My phone suddenly rang, and I looked down to see the number of the "Melrod Morning Post." It was a familiar voice on the other end, the newspaper editor Martin, his tone as urgent as ants on a hot pan: "Lucas, where are you? Last night's incident has blown up, readers want the inside scoop! Didn't you say you have acquaintances at the police station? Get some juicy details out, we can talk about the fee! 50,000." I was stunned, feeling like there was a rock stuck in my throat. Andrey's face flashed in my mind, lying bloody on the ground, yet here I was being pressed to write an "inside scoop"?</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"我……"我张了张嘴，没说出个所以然。脑子里乱成一团，一半想挂电话，一半又觉得这或许是个出口。马丁还在那儿催："别犹豫了，你不是干这行的吗？快点，明天就得见报！"我握着手机，手抖得厉害，最后挤出一句："我再想想。"没等他回话，我挂了电话，扔到沙发上。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"I..." I opened my mouth but couldn't get words out. My mind was in chaos, half wanting to hang up the phone, half feeling this might be an outlet. Martin was still pressing: "Don't hesitate, isn't this your job? Hurry up, it needs to be published tomorrow!" I held the phone, my hand trembling badly, and finally squeezed out a sentence: "Let me think about it." Without waiting for his response, I hung up and tossed the phone onto the sofa.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">窗外，戒严后的街道空荡荡的，只有偶尔传来的警笛声。电视还在播，波尔的声音又响起来，反反复复强调"破案""正义"。我关了电视，屋里陷入一片死寂。我靠在沙发上，盯着天花板，左臂的伤口隐隐作痛。安德利死了，成了英雄，可我还活着，夹在记者和警官的身份里，像个没着落的鬼魂。报社要猛料，可我手里的东西，到底该不该抖出去？</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Outside the window, the streets under martial law were empty, with only occasional sounds of sirens. The TV was still on, with Paul's voice coming up again, repeatedly emphasizing "solving the case" and "justice." I turned off the TV, and the house fell into complete silence. I leaned back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling, the wound on my left arm aching dully. Andrey was dead, now a hero, but I was still alive, caught between the identities of a reporter and a police officer, like a ghost with no place to go. The newspaper wanted inside information, but should I really disclose what I knew?</p>
