                    <p class="zh-content">第三节：港口三区</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Section 3: Port District Three</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">刚挂了电话，手机又震起来，这次是人事部门的内线号码。我接起来，那头是个熟悉的官僚腔："三级警官，卢卡斯维尔纳，港口三区警局分队遇袭，正在交火，缺人手，马上过去支援！"没等我回话，那家伙就挂了，像怕我找借口推脱似的。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just as I hung up the phone, my cell vibrated again. This time it was an internal number from the Personnel Department. I answered, and on the other end was a familiar bureaucratic tone: "Level Three Officer, Lucas Werner, Port District Three Police Station Team is under attack, currently exchanging fire, short-staffed, go provide support immediately!" Before I could respond, the guy hung up, as if afraid I'd make excuses to back out.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我盯着手机骂了句脏话，上级那帮人永远这德行，出了事就知道抓壮丁，平时开会倒是满嘴"资源优化""合理调度"。我真受够了那群西装革履的嘴脸，但没办法，警徽在兜里揣着，跑不掉的活儿还得干。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I stared at my phone and cursed. Those higher-ups were always like this—when something happened, all they knew was to grab anyone available. During meetings, though, they were all about "resource optimization" and "reasonable scheduling." I was really sick of those suit-wearing faces, but there was no choice. With my badge in my pocket, work I couldn't run from still had to be done.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我翻出通讯录，拨给了安德利——我的老搭档，四十六岁，微胖但动作快得像只猫。这家伙是个怪胎，正义感强得有时候一根筋，尤其是喝了酒以后，能跟你扯上半小时"这该死的世界"有多烂。他嗜酒如命，酒量好得吓人，但也因为酒驾被停职过好几次。要不是他枪法准得像开了挂，估计早被踢出局了。电话响了两声，他接起来，声音里带着点刚睡醒的沙哑："卢卡斯？这时候打电话，准没好事。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I flipped through my contacts and called Andrey—my old partner, forty-six years old, slightly chubby but as quick as a cat. The guy was a weirdo, with such a strong sense of justice that he was sometimes stubborn, especially after drinking, when he could go on for half an hour about how "this damned world" was so messed up. He was addicted to alcohol, with a frighteningly good capacity for it, but had been suspended several times for drunk driving. If his shooting hadn't been as accurate as if he were cheating, he would have been kicked out long ago. The phone rang twice before he picked up, his voice carrying a hint of just-woken-up hoarseness: "Lucas? Calling at this hour, can't be anything good."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"港口爆炸了，还有海港三区警局分队挨了枪子儿，通报正在对峙，局里让我们过去支援。你在哪儿？跟我走一趟。"我一边说一边下楼，夜风夹着烧焦的味道扑面而来。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"The port exploded, and the Port District Three Police Station Team is under fire. Reports say they're in a standoff. The bureau wants us to go provide support. Where are you? Come with me." I spoke while heading downstairs, the night wind carrying a burnt smell hitting me in the face.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">安德利那边顿了顿，估计在揉脸清醒，然后笑了声："爆炸了？我说刚才声音那么响，这该死的世界，又不让人安心。我在老地方，'锈锚酒吧'，刚喝了两杯。你过来接我，十五分钟后见。"说完他挂了，我能想象他那张圆脸上一边咧嘴一边骂娘的表情。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">There was a pause on Andrey's end, probably as he rubbed his face to wake up, then he laughed: "Exploded? I was wondering why it was so loud earlier. This damned world, never letting people rest easy. I'm at the usual place, 'Rusty Anchor Bar,' just had a couple of drinks. Come pick me up, see you in fifteen minutes." With that, he hung up. I could imagine his round face, grinning on one side while cursing on the other.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我开车到锈锚酒吧时，安德利已经站在门口，手里拎着件皱巴巴的外套，嘴里叼着根没点燃的烟。他一上车就拍了拍我的肩膀："爆炸案还没消停，又来枪战，梅罗德这是要上天啊？"我没搭腔，直接踩油门往港口三区冲。车窗外，警笛声越来越近，空气里开始混进火药味。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When I drove to the Rusty Anchor Bar, Andrey was already standing at the entrance, holding a wrinkled jacket in his hand and an unlit cigarette between his lips. As soon as he got in the car, he patted my shoulder: "The explosion case hasn't settled down yet, and now there's a gunfight. Is Melrod trying to take off?" I didn't respond, just stepped on the gas and headed toward Port District Three. Outside the window, the sound of police sirens grew closer, and the smell of gunpowder began to mix into the air.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">到了现场，我差点没认出那是警局分队的地盘。整个街区像被战火洗了一遍，警车翻了两辆，还有三辆着这火，玻璃碴子满地都是，墙上全是弹孔。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When we arrived at the scene, I almost didn't recognize it as the police team's territory. The entire block looked like it had been washed by war, with two police cars overturned and three more on fire. Glass shards were everywhere, and the walls were riddled with bullet holes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"我操他妈！这里发生了什么？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"What the hell happened here?!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">分队的几个家伙缩在掩体后面，朝街对面一栋停车场的一楼还击，子弹打得砖墙噼啪作响。对面火力不弱，从声音判断，有点32口径手枪、点56冲锋枪和几支霰弹枪，对面扫射声压得人喘不过气。我和安德利下车，猫着腰跑过去，一个年轻警员看见我，喊了声："维尔纳警官！谢天谢地，援兵总算来了！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Several guys from the team were huddled behind cover, returning fire toward the first floor of a parking garage across the street, bullets making the brick walls crack and pop. The firepower from the other side wasn't weak; from the sound, there were .32 caliber handguns, Type 56 submachine guns, and several shotguns. The barrage of fire from across the street was suffocating. Andrey and I got out of the car, crouching as we ran over. A young officer saw me and shouted: "Officer Werner! Thank God, reinforcements have finally arrived!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"援个屁，就我们俩！"我吼回去，掏出枪靠在一辆撞坏的警车后面。安德利蹲在我旁边，眯着眼观察对面，嘴里嘀咕："这该死的世界，连警察窝都能炸成这样。"他从腰间拔出手枪，咔哒一声上膛，咧嘴笑了，"不过也好，省得我晚上睡不着。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Reinforcements my ass, it's just the two of us!" I shouted back, pulling out my gun and leaning against a damaged police car. Andrey crouched beside me, squinting as he observed the other side, muttering: "This damned world, even a police nest can be blown up like this." He drew his gun from his waist, made a clicking sound as he chambered a round, and grinned. "Though it's not all bad, saves me from lying awake tonight."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我扫了眼现场，地上躺着两具尸体，都是分队的，一个胸口中了好几枪，血淌了一地；另一个脑袋开了花，估计当场就没了。对面停车场里的人影晃动还有没跑掉的市民，至少七八个，射击密度较大，像是有备而来。我咬牙，心想这他妈肯定不是普通的帮派火拼，背后肯定有更大的猫腻。可现在没工夫多想，得先把眼前这摊子收拾了再说。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I surveyed the scene. On the ground lay two bodies, both from the team. One had been shot several times in the chest, blood pooling around him; the other's head was a mess, probably died instantly. Shadows moved in the parking garage across the street, along with citizens who hadn't managed to escape—at least seven or eight attackers, with high shooting density, suggesting they came prepared. I gritted my teeth, thinking this definitely wasn't an ordinary gang fight; there had to be something bigger behind it. But there was no time to think too much now; we needed to deal with the immediate situation first.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"安德利，掩护我，我绕过去看看能不能包抄。"我低声说。他点点头，端起枪，朝停车场就是一梭子精准点射，压得对面火力一顿。我趁机窜出去，贴着街边的废车跑，心跳快得像擂鼓。这晚上，真是越来越热闹了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Andrey, cover me. I'll circle around and see if I can flank them," I said quietly. He nodded, raised his gun, and fired a burst of precise shots toward the parking garage, suppressing the opposing fire momentarily. I took the opportunity to dart out, running along the abandoned cars at the edge of the street, my heart pounding like a drum. This night was getting more and more lively.</p>
