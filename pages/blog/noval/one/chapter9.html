                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">验尸房里，冷光灯下的气氛越来越凝重。科尔站在尸体旁，手里攥着一堆文件和现场照片，低头翻来覆去地看，时不时瞥一眼维克托剖开的尸体。他的眉头越皱越紧，像在脑子里拼一幅拼图，可拼到一半发现缺了几块。维克托刚从那家伙胃里掏出一团黏糊糊的东西，嘀咕了句："啧，吃的是海鲜，挺新鲜还没消化完，估计死前两小时刚吃过。"科尔猛地抬头，盯着那团残渣看了半天，又翻出一张南门附近的监控截图，低声自言自语："两小时前……港口南门附近有家海鲜摊……"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">In the morgue, the atmosphere under the cold lights grew increasingly tense. Cole stood by the body, clutching a pile of documents and scene photos, flipping through them repeatedly, occasionally glancing at the body Viktor was dissecting. His brow furrowed more and more, as if piecing together a puzzle in his mind, only to find several pieces missing halfway through. Viktor had just extracted a sticky mass from the man's stomach and muttered: "Hmm, seafood, quite fresh and not fully digested yet. Probably eaten about two hours before death." Cole suddenly looked up, stared at the remains for a while, then pulled out a surveillance screenshot from near the south gate, mumbling to himself: "Two hours ago... there's a seafood stall near the port's south gate..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">他似乎有了什么想法，可眼神里满是不确定，像在一条窄巷里摸黑走路，怕撞上墙又怕踩空。我和安德利站在旁边，懒得插嘴，维克托倒是瞥了他一眼，幽默地问："小伙子，想通了啥？别憋着，憋坏了脑子我可不给你开。"科尔没笑，抿了抿嘴，把文件一合，说："有些猜测，但还得再查。"他没明说，可那副藏着掖着的样子，谁都看得出来他在憋大招，估计是想整理好了去邀功。我们仨对视一眼，心里都哼了一声——这小子，二十六岁就这么会玩心眼，果然是高材生。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">He seemed to have an idea, but his eyes were full of uncertainty, like walking blindly down a narrow alley, afraid of hitting a wall or missing a step. Andrey and I stood nearby, not bothering to interject, but Viktor glanced at him and humorously asked: "What've you figured out, young man? Don't hold back. If you burst your brain, I'm not going to operate on it." Cole didn't smile, pursed his lips, closed the file, and said: "Some conjectures, but I need to check further." He didn't elaborate, but from his secretive manner, everyone could tell he was holding back something big, probably wanting to organize it well before claiming credit. The three of us exchanged glances, inwardly snorting—this kid, only twenty-six and already so calculating, truly a top graduate.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔招呼迈克和托马斯过来，把一堆材料塞给他们，低声说了几句，两人点点头就跟着他走了。临走前，他回头看了我一眼，语气硬邦邦地说："维尔纳，你先去大厅待命，别乱跑。"我懒得跟他犟，耸耸肩，跟安德利出了验尸房。走到过道时，我从大厅的玻璃窗瞥见科尔和莱门斯站在角落里说话。莱门斯还是那副西装革履的派头，可脸上没了往日的从容，眉头皱着，像听到了什么让他意外的东西。科尔低声说着，手里比划了几下，莱门斯听完，眼神闪过一丝疑惑，拍了拍他肩膀，转身走了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole called Mike and Thomas over, handed them a stack of materials, said something in a low voice, and the two nodded and followed him out. Before leaving, he looked back at me and said in a rigid tone: "Werner, go wait in the lobby. Don't wander off." I didn't bother to argue with him, just shrugged and left the morgue with Andrey. As we walked down the corridor, I glimpsed through the lobby's glass window Cole and Lemons talking in a corner. Lemons still maintained his suited, polished appearance, but the usual composure was gone from his face, his brow furrowed as if he'd heard something unexpected. Cole spoke softly, gesturing with his hands a few times. After listening, Lemons' eyes flashed with a hint of doubt. He patted Cole's shoulder, then turned and left.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">没过多久，警笛声刚消停的指挥大厅又热闹起来。我们都被叫到一楼开会，屋里挤满了人，烟味儿和汗味儿混在一起，呛得人头晕。莱门斯站在前面，手里拿着一杯咖啡，目光扫过我们，开了口："今晚的事，闹得够大了。港口爆炸，三区枪战，桥车炸街，联邦的人已经盯着咱们了。我不管你们心里怎么想，从现在起，管好自己的嘴，别瞎说；管好自己的眼，别瞎看；没事别找事，做好本职工作，随时待命。"他顿了顿，声音低下去，"爆炸的船只序号B23－660，属于一家境外公司无从查起。船上运了什么，资料遗失；船员，都烧焦了；港口资料，遗失了；事情比我们想象的更要复杂。小伙子们，我要求你们打起精神，24小时随身带枪，每人五个弹夹，两人一组，进入红色极不安全等级状态。谁要是敢私下跟媒体见面，尤其是你，卢卡斯——"他点了我的名，眼神冷冷地扫过来，"别怪我不客气。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Before long, the command hall, where the sound of sirens had just quieted down, was buzzing again. We were all called to a meeting on the first floor. The room was packed with people, the smell of smoke and sweat mixing together, making one dizzy. Lemons stood at the front, holding a cup of coffee, his gaze sweeping over us as he began: "Tonight's events have gotten big enough. Port explosion, District Three gunfight, bridge car bombing—federal agents are already watching us. I don't care what you think, but from now on, control your mouths, don't say what you shouldn't; control your eyes, don't look where you shouldn't; don't look for trouble, do your jobs, and be ready at any time." He paused, his voice lowering, "The exploded vessel, number B23-660, belongs to a foreign company that's untraceable. What was on the ship? Records lost. Crew? All charred. Port records? Missing. Things are more complicated than we imagined. Boys, I require you to stay alert, carry your guns 24 hours a day, five magazines per person, two people as a team, entering a red-level, extremely unsafe status. Anyone who dares to meet the media privately, especially you, Lucas—" he singled me out, his eyes sweeping over coldly, "don't blame me for being unfriendly."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我靠在椅子上，手里转着烟，没吭声。安德利低声嘀咕："这该死的世界，连喘口气都不让。"莱门斯没理他，继续说："这城市现在是火药桶，谁都别给我添乱。听明白了吗？"屋里一片低低的应声，他点点头，把话头扔给了科尔。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I leaned back in my chair, twirling a cigarette in my hand, saying nothing. Andrey muttered under his breath: "This damned world, won't even let you catch your breath." Lemons ignored him and continued: "This city is now a powder keg. No one cause me any more trouble. Understood?" A chorus of low acknowledgments filled the room. He nodded and turned the floor over to Cole.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔走上前，手里拿着一叠整理好的材料，清了清嗓子，开始讲："根据现场照片、弹壳、弹道、遗留物和法医的初步分析，南门的袭击者是受过训练的武装人员，可能是雇佣兵。三区的枪战和桥车爆炸也不像临时行动和个案，背后肯定有联系。港口爆炸，可能牵出了更大的东西——可能是走私、贪腐，药物，武器甚至更可怕的阴谋。"他顿了顿，语气变得斩钉截铁，"但不管是谁干的，我们会伸张正义并把他们干掉。另外我要强调，交战规则和行动原则都得依法办事，谨记法律至上。不许休假，不许随意申请换岗，不许接触媒体，封锁现场不许任何人进入港口和交战地点，不许动用私刑，没有允许不许单人接触物证，遵守警察道德准则和交战手册，枪械报备，保持战备和咖啡供应，开放全局所有的厕所和床位，每组一辆汽车，征用市政车辆……"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole stepped forward, holding a stack of organized materials, cleared his throat, and began: "Based on scene photos, shell casings, ballistics, remnants, and the medical examiner's preliminary analysis, the attackers at the south gate were trained armed personnel, possibly mercenaries. The District Three gunfight and bridge car explosion also don't appear to be impromptu actions or isolated incidents; there must be connections behind them. The port explosion may have uncovered something bigger—possibly smuggling, corruption, drugs, weapons, or even more terrifying conspiracies." He paused, his tone becoming firm and resolute, "But no matter who did it, we will uphold justice and take them down. Additionally, I must emphasize that engagement rules and operational principles must follow legal procedures. Remember, the law is supreme. No vacations, no arbitrary requests for post changes, no contact with the media, sealed scenes with no entry to the port or combat locations, no use of vigilante justice, no individual contact with evidence without permission, adherence to police ethical codes and combat manuals, firearms registration, maintenance of readiness and coffee supplies, opening of all station restrooms and beds, one car per team, requisitioning municipal vehicles..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯站在旁边，抽了口雪茄，嘴角微微一撇，露出一丝不屑。科尔还在讲他的规则，条条是道，像课堂上背书，可那股理想主义的劲儿让人觉得有点虚。迈克低声嘀咕："说得好听，真碰上硬茬，还不是得靠拳头。"托马斯冷冷地瞪了他一眼，没接话。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons stood to the side, took a puff of his cigar, the corner of his mouth slightly curling, revealing a hint of disdain. Cole continued listing his rules, all by the book, like reciting in a classroom, but that idealistic vigor seemed somewhat hollow. Mike muttered under his breath: "Sounds nice, but when you really meet tough cases, it still comes down to fists." Thomas gave him a cold stare but didn't respond.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">会散了，我和安德利走出大厅，空气里似乎还飘着莱门斯的警告和科尔的讲话。我点了根烟，吐出去。安德利哼笑一声："这该死的世界。走吧，找个地儿喝一杯，清醒清醒。"我没动，盯着窗外港口的方向，心里总觉得有什么东西漏了，可又抓不住。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">As the meeting dispersed, Andrey and I walked out of the hall, the air still seeming to carry Lemons' warning and Cole's speech. I lit a cigarette and exhaled. Andrey snorted a laugh: "This damned world. Come on, let's find a place to have a drink, clear our heads." I didn't move, staring in the direction of the port outside the window, feeling like something was missing, but unable to grasp what it was.</p>
