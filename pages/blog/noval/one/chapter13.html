                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">警笛声划破了清晨的寂静，莱门斯和科尔带队冲到街角时，现场已经是一片狼藉。安德利的血染红了路面，三个袭击者的尸体横七竖八地倒在面包车旁，空气里弥漫着火药和血腥味儿。这里是富人区，街边是修剪整齐的树篱和高大的独栋别墅，平时安静得像墓地，可现在却炸开了锅。几个穿着睡袍的居民跑出来，扯着嗓子嚷嚷："这什么治安？枪战都打到家门口了！我要起诉你们警局，不作为，扰民！"一个秃顶的中年男人挥着手机，大声喊："我纳税养你们，不是让你们在这儿开战！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The sound of police sirens shattered the morning silence. When Lemons and Cole led the team to the street corner, the scene was already a mess. Andrey's blood had stained the ground red, and three attackers' bodies lay sprawled by the van, with the air filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood. This was the wealthy district, lined with neatly trimmed hedges and tall detached villas, usually as quiet as a cemetery, but now it had exploded into chaos. Several residents in bathrobes came running out, shouting at the top of their lungs: "What kind of security is this? Gunfights at our doorstep! I'm going to sue your police station for negligence and disturbing the peace!" A balding middle-aged man waved his phone, yelling loudly: "I pay taxes to support you, not for you to wage war here!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔皱了皱眉，走上前，声音平稳却带着股让人安心的力量："各位，请冷静。这是一起突发事件，我们已经控制住了局面。回去休息，之后会有专人跟进处理。"他脸上挤出个职业化的笑，语气不卑不亢，几句话就把人群哄得消停了点。一个老太太嘀咕了句"年轻人还挺会说话"，转身回了屋。科尔的社交能力果然不是盖的，愣是把周围的不满压了下去。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole frowned, stepped forward, and spoke with a steady voice that carried a reassuring strength: "Everyone, please calm down. This is an emergency situation, and we have the situation under control. Please go back and rest; specialized personnel will follow up later." He forced a professional smile on his face, his tone neither servile nor overbearing, and in just a few sentences had the crowd somewhat pacified. An elderly lady muttered, "The young man is quite articulate," and turned to go back inside. Cole's social skills were indeed remarkable, managing to suppress the surrounding discontent.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我坐在路边，盯着安德利的尸体，脑子里一片空荡。左臂的伤口还在渗血，可我忽得感觉不到疼了，只觉得虚得像被掏空了壳子。安德利的笑声还在耳边晃，他那句"这该死的世界"像根钉子扎在我脑子里。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I sat by the roadside, staring at Andrey's body, my mind completely empty. The wound on my left arm was still bleeding, but suddenly I couldn't feel the pain anymore; I just felt hollow, as if my shell had been emptied out. Andrey's laughter still echoed in my ears, and his phrase "this damn world" stuck in my mind like a nail.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我想起我们第一次搭档，在南区追一个毒贩，他喝得半醉还一枪崩了人家轮胎，回头冲我咧嘴笑："卢卡斯，这活儿没酒可不行。"还有一次在酒吧，他拍着我肩膀说："咱俩要是死一块儿，也算值了。"现在他死了，我却还坐在这儿，活着像个笑话。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I remembered our first partnership, chasing a drug dealer in the South District. He was half-drunk but still managed to shoot out the dealer's tire, then turned to me with a grin: "Lucas, this job's no good without alcohol." And another time at the bar, he patted my shoulder and said: "If we die together, it would be worth it." Now he was dead, and I was still sitting here, alive like some joke.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯走过来，蹲在我旁边，抽了口雪茄，吐出一团烟雾："卢卡斯，振作点。干这行，见惯了生死离别，今天是你，明天可能是我。眼观六路，耳听八方。你们做得很好。坏人得到了制裁，你们伸张了正义，做了一个警察应该做的，你们都是英雄。"他声音低沉，带着股看透一切的疲惫，"安德利是个好搭档，可人没了就没了，别让自己陷进去。我还需要你干大事。"我没抬头，红框泛红，喉咙里挤出一句："他不该死在这儿。"莱门斯拍拍我肩膀，没再说话，起身走开了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons walked over, squatted beside me, took a puff of his cigar, and exhaled a cloud of smoke: "Lucas, pull yourself together. In this line of work, we're used to life and death, today it's you, tomorrow it might be me. Stay vigilant. You both did well. The bad guys got what they deserved, you upheld justice, did what a police officer should do, you're both heroes." His voice was deep, carrying a weariness of someone who had seen it all. "Andrey was a good partner, but once someone's gone, they're gone. Don't let yourself get trapped in it. I still need you for important work." I didn't look up, my eyes reddening, and I squeezed out from my throat: "He shouldn't have died here." Lemons patted my shoulder, said nothing more, and got up to walk away.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"操！他才刚刚还完了贷款！操！"我的情绪进一步激动起来, 眼泪也呼之欲出。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Fuck! He had just paid off his loan! Fuck!" My emotions escalated further, and tears were about to burst forth.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔带着几个法医过来，围着三具尸体忙活。维克托蹲在地上，手里拿着一把镊子，翻了翻其中一个家伙的口袋，低声说："这几个身上的弹孔，跟三区第二次枪击案的弹壳对得上。衣服上有油漆和海水味儿，估计是逃出来的那拨人。"科尔点点头，低头翻着一本小册子，语气坚定："他们就是海港三区枪战的漏网之鱼，跑不远就撞上了你们。"他瞥了我一眼，眼底闪过一丝同情，可没说出口。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole came over with several forensic experts, busy around the three corpses. Viktor squatted on the ground, holding a pair of tweezers, flipping through one of the guy's pockets, and said in a low voice: "The bullet holes on these guys match the shell casings from the second shooting in District Three. There's paint and seawater smell on their clothes, probably the group that escaped." Cole nodded, looking down at a small booklet, his tone firm: "They are the escapees from the harbor District Three gunfight, didn't get far before running into you." He glanced at me, a flash of sympathy in his eyes, but he didn't voice it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我被抬上救护车，左臂包了绷带，医生说伤得不重，休养几天就好。我的脑子很乱，闭上眼都是安德烈倒下去的那一刻。到了医院，简单处理后，我回了家。屋里安静得让人发慌，阳台上还放着前几天安德利喝剩的啤酒瓶。我瘫在沙发上，盯着天花板，点了一根烟，可抽到一半就掐了。烟味儿让我想起他，想起那个满嘴"这该死的世界"的家伙。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I was lifted into the ambulance, my left arm bandaged. The doctor said the injury wasn't severe and would heal after a few days of rest. My mind was in chaos; every time I closed my eyes, I saw the moment Andrey fell. After simple treatment at the hospital, I returned home. The house was eerily quiet, and on the balcony still sat the beer bottles Andrey had left unfinished days ago. I collapsed on the sofa, stared at the ceiling, lit a cigarette, but extinguished it halfway through. The smell of smoke reminded me of him, that guy who always said "this damn world."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">窗外，天彻底亮了，梅罗德的天空灰蒙蒙的，像块脏布。街上的喧嚣远了，可我心里的空洞却越来越大。安德利没了，这烂摊子还在，可我不知道自己还能撑多久。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Outside the window, the day had fully dawned, Melrod's sky gray and hazy, like a dirty cloth. The noise from the street had faded, but the emptiness in my heart was growing. Andrey was gone, this mess was still here, but I didn't know how much longer I could hold on.</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">警笛声划破了清晨的寂静，莱门斯和科尔带队冲到街角时，现场已经是一片狼藉。安德利的血染红了路面，三个袭击者的尸体横七竖八地倒在面包车旁，空气里弥漫着火药和血腥味儿。这里是富人区，街边是修剪整齐的树篱和高大的独栋别墅，平时安静得像墓地，可现在却炸开了锅。几个穿着睡袍的居民跑出来，扯着嗓子嚷嚷："这什么治安？枪战都打到家门口了！我要起诉你们警局，不作为，扰民！"一个秃顶的中年男人挥着手机，大声喊："我纳税养你们，不是让你们在这儿开战！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The sound of police sirens shattered the morning silence. When Lemons and Cole led the team to the street corner, the scene was already a mess. Andrey's blood had stained the ground red, and three attackers' bodies lay sprawled by the van, with the air filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood. This was the wealthy district, lined with neatly trimmed hedges and tall detached villas, usually as quiet as a cemetery, but now it had exploded into chaos. Several residents in bathrobes came running out, shouting at the top of their lungs: "What kind of security is this? Gunfights at our doorstep! I'm going to sue your police station for negligence and disturbing the peace!" A balding middle-aged man waved his phone, yelling loudly: "I pay taxes to support you, not for you to wage war here!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔皱了皱眉，走上前，声音平稳却带着股让人安心的力量："各位，请冷静。这是一起突发事件，我们已经控制住了局面。回去休息，之后会有专人跟进处理。"他脸上挤出个职业化的笑，语气不卑不亢，几句话就把人群哄得消停了点。一个老太太嘀咕了句"年轻人还挺会说话"，转身回了屋。科尔的社交能力果然不是盖的，愣是把周围的不满压了下去。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole frowned, stepped forward, and spoke with a steady voice that carried a reassuring strength: "Everyone, please calm down. This is an emergency situation, and we have the situation under control. Please go back and rest; specialized personnel will follow up later." He forced a professional smile on his face, his tone neither servile nor overbearing, and in just a few sentences had the crowd somewhat pacified. An elderly lady muttered, "The young man is quite articulate," and turned to go back inside. Cole's social skills were indeed remarkable, managing to suppress the surrounding discontent.</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我坐在路边，盯着安德利的尸体，脑子里一片空荡。左臂的伤口还在渗血，可我忽得感觉不到疼了，只觉得虚得像被掏空了壳子。安德利的笑声还在耳边晃，他那句"这该死的世界"像根钉子扎在我脑子里。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I sat by the roadside, staring at Andrey's body, my mind completely empty. The wound on my left arm was still bleeding, but suddenly I couldn't feel the pain anymore; I just felt hollow, as if my shell had been emptied out. Andrey's laughter still echoed in my ears, and his phrase "this damn world" stuck in my mind like a nail.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我想起我们第一次搭档，在南区追一个毒贩，他喝得半醉还一枪崩了人家轮胎，回头冲我咧嘴笑："卢卡斯，这活儿没酒可不行。"还有一次在酒吧，他拍着我肩膀说："咱俩要是死一块儿，也算值了。"现在他死了，我却还坐在这儿，活着像个笑话。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I remembered our first partnership, chasing a drug dealer in the South District. He was half-drunk but still managed to shoot out the dealer's tire, then turned to me with a grin: "Lucas, this job's no good without alcohol." And another time at the bar, he patted my shoulder and said: "If we die together, it would be worth it." Now he was dead, and I was still sitting here, alive like some joke.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯走过来，蹲在我旁边，抽了口雪茄，吐出一团烟雾："卢卡斯，振作点。干这行，见惯了生死离别，今天是你，明天可能是我。眼观六路，耳听八方。你们做得很好。坏人得到了制裁，你们伸张了正义，做了一个警察应该做的，你们都是英雄。"他声音低沉，带着股看透一切的疲惫，"安德利是个好搭档，可人没了就没了，别让自己陷进去。我还需要你干大事。"我没抬头，红框泛红，喉咙里挤出一句："他不该死在这儿。"莱门斯拍拍我肩膀，没再说话，起身走开了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons walked over, squatted beside me, took a puff of his cigar, and exhaled a cloud of smoke: "Lucas, pull yourself together. In this line of work, we're used to life and death, today it's you, tomorrow it might be me. Stay vigilant. You both did well. The bad guys got what they deserved, you upheld justice, did what a police officer should do, you're both heroes." His voice was deep, carrying a weariness of someone who had seen it all. "Andrey was a good partner, but once someone's gone, they're gone. Don't let yourself get trapped in it. I still need you for important work." I didn't look up, my eyes reddening, and I squeezed out from my throat: "He shouldn't have died here." Lemons patted my shoulder, said nothing more, and got up to walk away.</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"操！他才刚刚还完了贷款！操！"我的情绪进一步激动起来, 眼泪也呼之欲出。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Fuck! He had just paid off his loan! Fuck!" My emotions escalated further, and tears were about to burst forth.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔带着几个法医过来，围着三具尸体忙活。维克托蹲在地上，手里拿着一把镊子，翻了翻其中一个家伙的口袋，低声说："这几个身上的弹孔，跟三区第二次枪击案的弹壳对得上。衣服上有油漆和海水味儿，估计是逃出来的那拨人。"科尔点点头，低头翻着一本小册子，语气坚定："他们就是海港三区枪战的漏网之鱼，跑不远就撞上了你们。"他瞥了我一眼，眼底闪过一丝同情，可没说出口。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole came over with several forensic experts, busy around the three corpses. Viktor squatted on the ground, holding a pair of tweezers, flipping through one of the guy's pockets, and said in a low voice: "The bullet holes on these guys match the shell casings from the second shooting in District Three. There's paint and seawater smell on their clothes, probably the group that escaped." Cole nodded, looking down at a small booklet, his tone firm: "They are the escapees from the harbor District Three gunfight, didn't get far before running into you." He glanced at me, a flash of sympathy in his eyes, but he didn't voice it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我被抬上救护车，左臂包了绷带，医生说伤得不重，休养几天就好。我的脑子很乱，闭上眼都是安德烈倒下去的那一刻。到了医院，简单处理后，我回了家。屋里安静得让人发慌，阳台上还放着前几天安德利喝剩的啤酒瓶。我瘫在沙发上，盯着天花板，点了一根烟，可抽到一半就掐了。烟味儿让我想起他，想起那个满嘴"这该死的世界"的家伙。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I was lifted into the ambulance, my left arm bandaged. The doctor said the injury wasn't severe and would heal after a few days of rest. My mind was in chaos; every time I closed my eyes, I saw the moment Andrey fell. After simple treatment at the hospital, I returned home. The house was eerily quiet, and on the balcony still sat the beer bottles Andrey had left unfinished days ago. I collapsed on the sofa, stared at the ceiling, lit a cigarette, but extinguished it halfway through. The smell of smoke reminded me of him, that guy who always said "this damn world."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">窗外，天彻底亮了，梅罗德的天空灰蒙蒙的，像块脏布。街上的喧嚣远了，可我心里的空洞却越来越大。安德利没了，这烂摊子还在，可我不知道自己还能撑多久。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Outside the window, the day had fully dawned, Melrod's sky gray and hazy, like a dirty cloth. The noise from the street had faded, but the emptiness in my heart was growing. Andrey was gone, this mess was still here, but I didn't know how much longer I could hold on.</p>
