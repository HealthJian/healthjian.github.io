                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">第二天清晨，运送尸检关键物证的车队从警局出发了。几辆黑色装甲车在雾气中缓缓前行，车灯划破黑暗，一切都像往常一样平静。欧文坐在第二辆车里，手里攥着对讲机，盯着窗外的海港，眉头紧锁。他知道这趟任务不简单，可没想到麻烦来得这么快。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The next morning, the convoy carrying the key evidence from the autopsy departed from the police station. Several black armored vehicles moved slowly through the fog, their headlights piercing the darkness, everything seemingly as peaceful as usual. Owen sat in the second car, gripping the walkie-talkie, staring at the harbor outside the window, his brows furrowed. He knew this mission wouldn't be simple, but he didn't expect trouble to come so quickly.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">车队刚上梅罗德大桥，头车突然轰的一声巨响，前轮被炸得飞起，整辆车翻滚着撞上护栏，火光冲天。驾驶员被一枪爆头，欧文被震得头晕耳鸣，肩膀撞在车门上，疼得骂了句脏话。他踹开车门滚出去，喊道："操！袭击！下车！找掩体！"随车的特勤警员反应迅速，纷纷跳出车厢，躲到桥墩和翻倒的车后，可还没站稳，密集的子弹就像雨点一样扫过来。对面是群雇佣兵，黑衣蒙面，装备精良，显然早有埋伏。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just as the convoy got onto Melrod Bridge, the lead car suddenly exploded with a loud bang, its front wheels blown off, the entire vehicle rolling and crashing into the guardrail with flames shooting skyward. The driver was shot in the head, and Owen was stunned, dizzy and ears ringing, his shoulder slammed against the car door, causing him to curse in pain. He kicked open the car door and rolled out, shouting: "Fuck! Attack! Get out! Find cover!" The special service officers in the vehicle reacted quickly, jumping out of the cars and hiding behind bridge piers and overturned vehicles, but before they could steady themselves, dense bullets swept over like raindrops. On the other side was a group of mercenaries, dressed in black with covered faces, well-equipped, obviously having laid an ambush in advance.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">特勤警员训练有素，端着冲锋枪还击，子弹打得桥面火花四溅。可对方人数占优，火力压得他们抬不起头。欧文躲在一块水泥墩后，右肩突然一麻，血顺着胳膊淌下来，他咬牙低骂："操，又挨了一枪。"眼看着手下一个个倒下，他红了眼，抓起枪还击，可雇佣兵已经围了过来，形势岌岌可危。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The special service officers were well-trained, firing back with submachine guns, bullets causing sparks to fly all over the bridge surface. But the other side had the advantage in numbers, their firepower so heavy that the officers couldn't raise their heads. Owen hid behind a concrete block, when suddenly his right shoulder went numb, blood flowing down his arm. He gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath: "Fuck, shot again." Watching his men fall one by one, his eyes reddened with anger as he grabbed his gun to return fire, but the mercenaries had already surrounded them, the situation becoming extremely precarious.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">就在这时，远处传来警笛声，巡逻警员和莱门斯带队赶到。莱门斯跳下车，西装都没来得及脱，手里端着枪就加入战圈，喊道："别让他们跑了！"巡逻警员散开掩护，和特勤一起反击，枪声震得桥面都在抖。莱门斯冷静指挥，火力渐渐压住对方，可雇佣兵显然不打算死磕，僵持不下。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just then, police sirens sounded in the distance as patrol officers led by Lemons arrived. Lemons jumped out of the car, not even having time to take off his suit, joining the fight with gun in hand, shouting: "Don't let them escape!" The patrol officers spread out to provide cover, counterattacking alongside the special service team, the gunfire so intense that the bridge surface shook. Lemons commanded calmly, gradually suppressing the enemy's firepower, but the mercenaries clearly didn't plan to fight to the death, resulting in a stalemate.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我当时正在咖啡馆，坐在艾琳对面，聊着她实习时遇到的奇葩客户。她笑得眼睛弯弯，我正端着咖啡傻乐，对讲机突然炸响："大桥遇袭，请求增援，所有附近警员立刻支援！我重复，大桥遇袭，请求增援，所有附近警员立刻支援！"我愣了下，抬头看了眼窗外，大桥的方向火光冲天，离这儿才三分钟路程。我扔下杯子，对艾琳说了句："我得去！"就冲了出去。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">At that time, I was in the cafe, sitting across from Erin, chatting about the bizarre clients she had encountered during her internship. She was smiling, her eyes curved into crescents, and I was happily holding my coffee when the walkie-talkie suddenly exploded with sound: "Bridge under attack, requesting reinforcements, all nearby officers provide immediate support! I repeat, bridge under attack, requesting reinforcements, all nearby officers provide immediate support!" I was stunned for a moment, looking up at the window, seeing flames shooting up in the direction of the bridge, just three minutes away from here. I dropped my cup, said to Erin: "I have to go!" and rushed out.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">跑到大桥时，场面乱得像战场。子弹横飞，空气里全是火药味儿。我扑到一辆警车后，掏枪加入战斗。越来越多的警力和特勤赶到，雇佣兵开始顶不住，有人喊了一声，扔下几颗手雷，轰轰几声，车队中间的装甲车被炸得直冒烟。趁着混乱，我咬牙绕到车队中央，凭直觉扑向一辆还没被炸的车，打开车门，找到个密封箱——关键证据！我拖出来时，托马斯跑过来帮忙，低声喊："快走！"迈克在旁边掩护，一枪崩了个冲过来的雇佣兵，喊道："跑啊，别愣着！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When I reached the bridge, the scene was as chaotic as a battlefield. Bullets were flying everywhere, and the air was filled with the smell of gunpowder. I dove behind a police car, pulled out my gun, and joined the fight. More and more police and special service units arrived, and the mercenaries began to falter. Someone shouted, throwing down several grenades, and with several loud bangs, the armored cars in the middle of the convoy were smoking from the explosions. Taking advantage of the chaos, I gritted my teeth and circled around to the center of the convoy, instinctively lunging toward a car that hadn't been blown up yet. I opened the door and found a sealed box—key evidence! As I dragged it out, Thomas ran over to help, whispering urgently: "Go quickly!" Mike provided cover nearby, shooting a mercenary who was charging towards us, shouting: "Run, don't just stand there!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">箱子刚拖到安全地带，身后轰的一声，整辆车炸了，热浪扑得我们几乎飞了出去。时间掐得刚刚好，我喘着粗气，托马斯拍拍我肩膀："干得漂亮。"欧文从掩体后站起来，右肩血淋淋的，走过来低声说："谢了，小子。你叫什么？"我喘了口气："卢卡斯·维尔纳。"他点点头，眼里多了点认可。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Just as we dragged the box to safety, there was a boom behind us—the entire car exploded, the heat wave nearly blowing us away. The timing was perfect. I gasped for breath, and Thomas patted my shoulder: "Well done." Owen stood up from behind cover, his right shoulder bloody, walked over and said quietly: "Thanks, kid. What's your name?" I took a breath: "Lucas Werner." He nodded, his eyes showing a bit more approval.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">没等喘口气，欧文喊道："追！别让他们跑了！"我们冲到桥边，眼睁睁看着剩下的雇佣兵跳进水里，黑影在海面上晃了几下就不见了。莱门斯抓起对讲机吼："通知海警，封锁水面！"可心里清楚，这帮家伙跑得太快。至少我们看清了他们的打扮——黑色战术服，白种人，装备精良得吓人。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Without a moment to catch our breath, Owen shouted: "Chase them! Don't let them escape!" We rushed to the edge of the bridge, watching helplessly as the remaining mercenaries jumped into the water, their dark silhouettes rippling on the water's surface before disappearing. Lemons grabbed the walkie-talkie and yelled: "Notify the marine police, seal off the water!" But deep down, he knew these guys were too fast. At least we saw clearly what they looked like—black tactical gear, Caucasian, frighteningly well-equipped.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文靠在护栏上，捂着肩膀，低声骂："这帮王八蛋，早有准备。"我盯着水面，心跳还没平下来。但证据总算保住了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen leaned against the railing, holding his shoulder, cursing under his breath: "These bastards, they were well prepared." I stared at the water's surface, my heartbeat still racing. But at least the evidence was safe.</p>
