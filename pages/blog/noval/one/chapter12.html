                    <p class="zh-content">欧文的黑色SUV车队离开警局，扬起一阵灰尘。一队直奔案发现场，另一队等待押着尸体和证据并往反恐特勤中心开。指挥大厅里，科尔没闲着，低声对几个警员交代："把所有资料和证据复制一份，能多快就多快，别让联邦拿走全部。"他动作麻利，眼底闪着股不服输的劲儿。莱门斯站在旁边，抽着雪茄，瞥了眼忙碌的科尔，对波尔笑着说："瞧瞧，警局总算是后继有人啊。年轻人保持活泛，做事机灵，脑子转得快。"波尔靠在椅子上，揉着太阳穴，哼了一声，没接话，可嘴角微微上扬，显然对科尔这股冲劲还算满意。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen's convoy of black SUVs left the police station, kicking up a cloud of dust. One team headed straight for the crime scene, while the other waited to escort the bodies and evidence to the Counter-Terrorism Special Service Center. In the command hall, Cole was busy, quietly instructing several officers: "Make copies of all materials and evidence, as quickly as possible, don't let the Feds take everything." He moved efficiently, with a determined gleam in his eyes. Lemons stood nearby, smoking a cigar, glanced at the busy Cole, and said to Paul with a smile: "Look at that, the police station finally has a worthy successor. The young man stays sharp, works smart, thinks quickly." Paul leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples, grunted without responding, but the slight upturn of his mouth showed he was reasonably satisfied with Cole's drive.</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">上面下了命令，让我和安德利把检察官勃利德送回家。我们仨挤进一辆警车，我开车，安德利坐副驾，勃利德窝在后座，一路上絮絮叨叨地抱怨："这城市真是变了样，当年多太平啊。现在人心浮躁，个个都跟疯了似的。今儿真是倒了八辈子霉，摊上这破事儿。"他叹了口气，推了推眼镜，"你们说，这日子还怎么过？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Orders came from above for Andrey and me to take Prosecutor Breed home. The three of us squeezed into a police car—I drove, Andrey sat in the passenger seat, and Breed huddled in the back, complaining the whole way: "This city has really changed, it used to be so peaceful. Now people are restless, everyone seems crazy. Today I've had the worst luck ever, getting caught up in this mess." He sighed, pushed his glasses up, "How do you think we can go on living like this?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">安德利点了根烟，吐了个烟圈，懒洋洋地回："这该死的世界，早就没太平日子了。你不也混得挺好？"我瞥了眼后视镜，接了一句："是啊，检察官，熬过去就行了，别想太多。"勃利德哼了一声，没再吭声，靠在座椅上闭目养神。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Andrey lit a cigarette, blew a smoke ring, and replied lazily: "This damned world hasn't seen peaceful days in a long time. Aren't you doing pretty well yourself?" I glanced in the rearview mirror and added: "That's right, Prosecutor, just get through it, don't overthink things." Breed grunted once, then fell silent, leaning back in his seat to rest his eyes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">把人送到家门口，天已经蒙蒙亮，街上的路灯昏黄得像快熄了。我们正准备开车回局里，拐过一个街角时，我眼尖，瞅见三个家伙鬼鬼祟祟地从巷子里出来，走路姿势像是受了伤，很异常。安德利也注意到了，低声说："卢卡斯，那几个不对劲。"我踩了刹车，眯眼一看，他们衣服下摆有暗红色的痕迹，是血迹。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">After dropping him off at his front door, dawn was just breaking, and the street lamps glowed a dim yellow as if about to go out. As we were about to drive back to the station, turning a corner, my sharp eyes caught three figures sneaking out of an alley, their walking posture suggesting they were injured, very unusual. Andrey noticed too and said quietly: "Lucas, something's not right with those guys." I stepped on the brake and squinted—there were dark red stains on the hems of their clothes: blood.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"跟上去。"我低声说，闪起了警灯，迅速靠过去。安德利掏出枪，检查了下弹夹，咧嘴一笑："这该死的世界，总有惊喜。"我们下了车，跑着靠近。那三人走到一辆破旧面包车旁，突然停下，其中一个回头看了我们一眼，眼神一冷，猛地掏枪就开火。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Let's follow them," I said softly, flashing the police lights and quickly approaching. Andrey pulled out his gun, checked the magazine, and grinned: "This damned world, always full of surprises." We got out of the car and ran toward them. The three men walked to an old van, suddenly stopped, and one of them looked back at us, his eyes turning cold, then suddenly drew a gun and opened fire.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"操！"我骂了一声，和安德利扑倒在地，子弹擦着头顶飞过去，打得墙上砖屑乱溅。我抓起对讲机吼："百花园31号西侧街角遇袭，三名武装人员，请求增援！百花园31号街角遇袭，三名武装人员，请求增援！"安德利已经还击，枪声脆得像鞭炮，一发子弹正中一个家伙的肩膀，那人闷哼一声倒地。可对方火力不弱，剩下的两个躲在面包车后，子弹像雨点似的扫过来。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Fuck!" I cursed, as Andrey and I dove to the ground, bullets whizzing past our heads, splattering brick fragments from the wall. I grabbed the radio and shouted: "Under attack at the west corner of 31 Flower Garden, three armed suspects, requesting backup! Under attack at the corner of 31 Flower Garden, three armed suspects, requesting backup!" Andrey was already returning fire, his gunshots as sharp as firecrackers, one bullet hitting a guy's shoulder, making him fall with a muffled groan. But the opposition's firepower wasn't weak; the remaining two hid behind the van, bullets raining down on us like hail.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我俩人少，火力压不住。我咬牙从掩体后探出身子开了两枪，左臂突然一麻，像是被锤子砸了一下，低头一看，血从袖子渗出来，一开始还感觉不到疼，呼的一下，疼得我龇牙咧嘴。伤得不重，可也够呛。安德利喊了声："卢卡斯，撑住！"他刚起身还击，腹部和胸口依次中弹，血喷得满地都是。他踉跄了一下，依靠惯性冲了几步并射了几枪，摔倒在地，枪掉在一边，嘴里喘着粗气："这该死……的世界……"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">We were outnumbered and couldn't suppress their fire. I gritted my teeth and leaned out from cover to fire twice, when suddenly my left arm went numb, as if struck by a hammer. Looking down, blood was seeping through my sleeve—at first, I couldn't feel the pain, then suddenly it hit me, making me grimace. The wound wasn't severe, but it was bad enough. Andrey shouted: "Lucas, hang on!" Just as he stood up to return fire, he was hit in the abdomen and chest in succession, blood spraying everywhere. He staggered, propelled by momentum for a few steps while firing several shots, then fell to the ground, his gun falling aside, gasping: "This damned... world..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"安德利！"我脑子一炸，怒火冲得我眼眶发红。他倒在地上，血淌了一片，眼睛半睁半闭，气息越来越弱。我扑过去想拖他到安全地方，可对面还在开枪，子弹打得车身叮叮当当。我红着眼，抓起他的枪，朝面包车后连开数枪，一个家伙应声倒下，另一个转身想跑。我没给他机会，追了过去，并一发子弹正中后脑，他扑倒在地，抽了两下不动了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Andrey!" My mind exploded, rage turning my eyes red. He lay on the ground, blood pooling around him, his eyes half-open, his breathing growing weaker. I lunged to drag him to safety, but the gunfire from across the street continued, bullets pinging against the car body. Red-eyed, I grabbed his gun and fired several shots at the van, dropping one of the guys, while the other turned to run. I didn't give him a chance—I chased after him and put a bullet right through the back of his head. He fell face-first to the ground, twitched twice, then lay still.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">街角安静下来四周的房屋纷纷亮起灯来，我粗重的喘息声，同时远处传来的警笛。安德利躺在我旁边，血染红了地面，眼睛盯着天，嘴里挤出最后一句话："卢卡斯……别……别他妈丧气……"然后头一歪，没了动静。我跪在他身边，手抖得握不住枪，喉咙里像堵了块石头，暴怒和痛混在一起，吼得嗓子都哑了："操你妈的！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The corner fell silent as lights came on in the surrounding houses, my heavy breathing punctuated by distant sirens. Andrey lay beside me, blood reddening the ground, his eyes fixed on the sky as he squeezed out his final words: "Lucas... don't... don't fucking lose heart..." Then his head slumped to one side, and he went still. I knelt beside him, my hands shaking too much to hold the gun, my throat feeling like it was blocked with a stone, rage and pain mingling as I screamed until my voice went hoarse: "Motherfucker!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">增援的车冲过来，警灯晃得我眼花。我低头看着安德利，脑子里一片空白。这该死的世界，终究还是把他吞了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Backup vehicles raced over, their lights flashing so brightly they made me dizzy. I looked down at Andrey, my mind completely blank. This damned world had finally swallowed him whole.</p>
