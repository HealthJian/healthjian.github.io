                    <p class="zh-content">站街的活儿比我想象得还无聊，海港外的风腥得像鱼摊，吹得我脸发僵。第一天站了十四个小时，除了拦住几个想翻栏杆的醉汉，啥也没干。我靠在路灯下，点了根烟，刚抽了两口，就看见一个熟悉的身影从街对面走过来——那个金发女人。她穿着一件灰色大衣，金发扎成低马尾，手里拎着个帆布包，走路漫不经心。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The job of standing on the street was even more boring than I had imagined, the wind outside the harbor was as fishy as a fish stall, making my face stiff. I stood for fourteen hours on the first day, and did nothing except stop a few drunks who wanted to climb over the railings. I leaned against a streetlight, lit a cigarette, had just taken two puffs when I saw a familiar figure walking across the street—that blonde woman. She was wearing a gray coat, her blonde hair tied in a low ponytail, carrying a canvas bag in her hand, walking casually.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我愣了下，烟差点烫了手。她走到街角，停下来，盯着地上安德利牺牲的那个方向，眼眶又红了。我扔了烟，走过去，低声问："你又来了？"她抬头看了我一眼，像是吓了一跳，可认出我后，眼里多了点复杂的东西。她擦了擦眼角，勉强挤出个笑："是你啊……"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I was stunned, the cigarette almost burning my hand. She walked to the corner, stopped, staring at the direction where Andrey had sacrificed himself, her eyes reddening again. I threw away the cigarette, walked over, and asked softly: "You came again?" She looked up at me, seemed startled, but after recognizing me, something complex appeared in her eyes. She wiped the corner of her eye, forcing out a smile: "It's you..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"卢卡斯·维尔纳。"我报了名字，顿了顿，她犹豫了下，低声说："艾琳……艾琳·罗森。"听到"罗森"这姓，我心跳快了一拍，可没表现出来，只是点点头："你常来这儿？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Lucas Verner." I gave my name, paused, she hesitated, then said softly: "Erin... Erin Rosen." Hearing the surname "Rosen," my heart beat faster, but I didn't show it, just nodded: "Do you come here often?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她咬了咬唇，像是下了很大决心才开口："这儿……死了一个对我很重要的人。五年前，他救过我。"她声音低下去，"他好像叫安德利。"我脑子里轰的一声，像被雷劈了。安德利救过她？五年前他还在南区跑街，那时候他确实干过不少救人的事儿，可从没跟我提过这个。我盯着她，低声问："怎么回事？"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">She bit her lip, as if she had made a big decision before speaking: "Here... someone very important to me died. Five years ago, he saved me." Her voice lowered, "I think his name was Andrey." There was a boom in my head, as if I had been struck by lightning. Andrey had saved her? Five years ago, he was still patrolling the South District, and he did save many people back then, but he had never mentioned this to me. I stared at her, asking softly: "What happened?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">艾琳靠在墙上，眼神飘向远处："那年我十七岁，跟朋友在南区玩，撞上帮派火拼。我差点被流弹打中，是他冲过来把我推开，自己肩膀中了一枪。"她顿了顿，眼泪又掉下来，"他没跟我要谢，只是让我赶紧走。后来我才知道他是个警察。"她苦笑了下，"前几天我偷偷来看他死的地方，被我爸发现了，他……他打了我一顿。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Erin leaned against the wall, her gaze drifting into the distance: "That year I was seventeen, playing with friends in the South District, when we ran into a gang shootout. I was almost hit by a stray bullet, but he rushed over and pushed me away, taking a shot in the shoulder himself." She paused, tears falling again, "He didn't ask for my thanks, just told me to leave quickly. Later I found out he was a policeman." She smiled bitterly, "A few days ago, I secretly came to see where he died, but my father found out, and he... he beat me."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"你爸？"我皱了眉，心里已经猜了个八九不离十。她点点头。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Your father?" I frowned, having already guessed most of it. She nodded.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">艾琳擦了擦眼泪，声音轻了些："我在大学修读新闻学，今年下半年毕业，现在开始实习了。我爸不让我干这个，说太没前途，可我不想听他的。"她看了我一眼，笑了笑，"你呢？你是警察吧？脸上写得清清楚楚。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Erin wiped away her tears, her voice becoming softer: "I'm studying journalism at university, graduating in the second half of this year, and I've started my internship now. My father doesn't want me to do this, says it has no future, but I don't want to listen to him." She looked at me, smiled, "What about you? You're a police officer, right? It's written all over your face."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我愣了下，心跳又快了几拍。她笑起来的样子美得像画，眼里却带着股倔强。我张了张嘴，想否认，可话到嘴边变成了："……是，我是警察。"她点点头，像早料到了，没追问，只是低声说："安德利是个好警察。我爸总说戴帽子的没有好东西，可我知道不是那样的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I was stunned, my heart beating faster. When she smiled, she was as beautiful as a painting, but there was a stubborn look in her eyes. I opened my mouth, wanting to deny it, but the words that came out were: "...Yes, I am a police officer." She nodded, as if she had expected it, didn't pursue the matter, just said softly: "Andrey was a good police officer. My father always says that those who wear hats have nothing good in them, but I know it's not like that."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">她聊了些有的没的，大学的事儿，实习的趣闻，语气轻松了些，可我却被她勾得魂儿都丢了。她身上有种让人放不下的东西，像阳光，又像风暴。我插不上话，只是听着，心跳越来越乱。她说完，看了看表："我得走了，我就是个话匣子，真没礼貌，我实习的地方还有事儿。"她顿了顿，转身前看了我一眼，"卢卡斯，谢谢你听我唠叨。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">She chatted about various things, university matters, internship anecdotes, her tone becoming more relaxed, but I was completely captivated by her. There was something about her that one couldn't let go of, like sunshine, yet also like a storm. I couldn't get a word in, just listened, my heartbeat becoming more and more chaotic. After she finished, she looked at her watch: "I have to go, I'm just a chatterbox, really impolite, I have things to do at my internship place." She paused, looked at me before turning around, "Lucas, thank you for listening to my ramblings."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"没事儿。"我挤出这句话，看着她走远。她的背影消失在街角，我点了根烟，狠狠抽了一口，脑子里全是她的话，这就是一见钟情吗？</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"It's nothing." I squeezed out these words, watching her walk away. Her figure disappeared around the corner, I lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, my mind full of her words, is this what love at first sight is?</p>
