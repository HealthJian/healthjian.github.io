                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文找到马丁时，事情已经热闹过头了。他推开一间汽车旅店的门，里面灯光昏暗，马丁被绑在椅子上，鼻青脸肿，嘴角淌着血，莱门斯站在旁边，还有几个莱门斯的手下，其中一个手里攥着根警棍，他们的脸上挂着冷笑。几个警员围着，气氛紧得像拉满的弦。欧文靠在门框上，抖了抖肩，低声说："哟，莱门斯警长，你这手段挺硬啊。"莱门斯瞥了他一眼，哼笑一声："我最烦喜欢小道消息的新闻记者，他们编制假新闻吸引大众的眼球，伤害公共利益而自己赚的盆满钵满。对付这种货色，不硬不行。"说完那个警官又一棍子下去，马丁惨叫一声，差点从椅子上栽下去。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">By the time Owen found Martin, things had already gotten out of hand. He pushed open the door of a motel, where the lighting was dim. Martin was tied to a chair, his face bruised and swollen, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. Lemons stood nearby, along with several of his subordinates, one of whom was clutching a police baton, cold smiles hanging on their faces. Several officers surrounded them, with an atmosphere as tense as a fully drawn bowstring. Owen leaned against the doorframe, shrugged his shoulders, and said in a low voice: "Well, Chief Lemons, your methods are quite harsh." Lemons glanced at him, snorted a laugh: "I hate news reporters who love gossip the most. They fabricate fake news to attract public attention, harming public interests while making themselves a fortune. For this kind of scum, you have to be harsh." After saying this, the officer brought down the baton again, and Martin let out a miserable cry, almost falling off the chair.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文没吭声，嘴角抽了抽，像在憋笑。马丁被打得鼻涕眼泪齐流，终于扛不住了，哑着嗓子喊："别打了！我全说！"他喘着气，把跟我的交易抖得干干净净："卢卡斯·维尔纳，他给我头条消息，拿了稿费，一共十五万！海鲜面和那篇卡尔失踪的文章就是他写的！"莱门斯眯着眼，点点头，又问："这小子果然不简单，机灵点，继续说，报社还有啥消息来源？"马丁捂着脸，哆哆嗦嗦地说："还有几个线人，街头混混、码头工人，都是一些零碎消息。但警局就只有他一个！所以我才出价这么高的。"他顿了顿，突然抬起头，"对了，我车后备箱的红色箱子有一些资料，我和他的聊天记录，还有一些他和艾琳开房的照片！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen remained silent, the corner of his mouth twitching, as if holding back laughter. Martin, beaten until his nose and tears were flowing, finally couldn't hold out any longer and shouted hoarsely: "Stop hitting me! I'll tell everything!" Gasping for breath, he confessed all the details of his deal with me: "Lucas Werner, he gave me headline news, took a fee, a total of 150,000! The seafood noodle article and the one about Carl's disappearance were written by him!" Lemons narrowed his eyes, nodded, and asked again: "This guy is indeed not simple. Be smart, continue talking. What other sources does the newspaper have?" Martin covered his face, trembling as he said: "There are a few informants, street thugs, dock workers, all just bits and pieces of information. But from the police station, he's the only one! That's why I offered such a high price." He paused, suddenly raising his head, "Oh right, in the red box in my car trunk, there are some materials, chat records between him and me, and some photos of him and Erin at a hotel!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">这话一出，屋里的人全愣了。欧文眼神一变，二话不说走出门，直奔马丁的车。莱门斯皱了皱眉，跟出去站在仓库门口，手里点了根雪茄，盯着夜色发呆。欧文翻开后备箱，掏出一叠照片和通话资料，借着路灯一看，眉头拧得更紧。接着他又继续翻了翻其他地方，有额外的发现，翻到了一个小本子——像是一个账册。照片里是海港的夜景，远处火光隐约，可前景有几个人影，模糊但能辨认出轮廓。小本子他打算回去继续看。他抓起手机拨给科尔："小子，马丁吐了，卢卡斯是个混蛋！我还有额外收获！有一张海港当晚的照片，你赶紧过来查查！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">At these words, everyone in the room was stunned. Owen's expression changed, and without another word, he walked out the door, heading straight for Martin's car. Lemons frowned, followed him out, and stood at the warehouse entrance, lighting a cigar, staring blankly into the night. Owen opened the trunk, pulled out a stack of photos and call records, and examined them under the streetlight, his brow furrowing even more. Then he continued to rummage through other places and made an additional discovery—a small notebook, seemingly a ledger. The photos showed the harbor at night, with faint flames in the distance, but in the foreground were several silhouettes, blurry but with recognizable outlines. He planned to examine the notebook more closely later. He grabbed his phone and called Cole: "Kid, Martin spilled everything. Lucas is a bastard! I've got extra findings! There's a photo of the harbor that night, come check it out right away!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">看这欧文离去的背影，莱门斯站在旅馆门外，雪茄烧了一半，烟雾飘在夜风里，若有所思。"警长！你的人做得太过分了。"马丁哭泣，又转悲为喜，一脸猥琐着说，"卢卡斯写的文章是一流的，可惜他干了警察！他是个贪污犯！他现在和那个恐怖分子的女儿整天呆在一起。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Watching Owen's departing silhouette, Lemons stood outside the motel door, his cigar half-burned, smoke drifting in the night breeze, lost in thought. "Chief! Your men went too far!" Martin cried, then quickly turned from grief to joy, saying with a lewd expression, "Lucas's articles are first-rate, it's a pity he became a cop! He's corrupt! Now he spends all his time with that terrorist's daughter."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"你打算怎么办？马丁，我对你用了私刑，其实就是想给欧文做做样子，你是媒体人。这怪不好意思的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"What are you planning to do? Martin, I used private punishment on you, actually just wanting to put on a show for Owen. You're a media person. This is somewhat embarrassing."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"假戏真做，道上的规矩我都懂！警长，把我放了吧！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Pretending turned real, I understand the rules of the game! Chief, please let me go!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯给手下使了一个眼色，马丁被松绑了，莱门斯说道："管好你的嘴！"让后转身走了……</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons gave his subordinates a knowing look, and Martin was untied. Lemons said, "Keep your mouth shut!" Then he turned and left...</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔接到电话时，正跟秘书和维克托在警局地下室翻尸检残骸的理化结果。维克托翻着一堆报告，低声说："这退役军人的数据库三年前被删了，现在正在恢复，得等等。"科尔咬着牙，没耐心等，扔下一句："我去市政人力局调档案，你盯着结果。"，他的手里警力不够，对于我他只能先暂时搁置我这个"叛徒"。说完他抓起车钥匙冲出去，开车直奔人力局，路上差点闯红灯。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">When Cole received the call, he was in the police station basement with his secretary and Victor, going through the chemical analysis results of autopsy remains. Victor flipped through a stack of reports, saying in a low voice: "The database for veterans was deleted three years ago, it's being restored now, we'll have to wait." Cole gritted his teeth, lacking patience to wait, and tossed out a sentence: "I'm going to the Municipal Human Resources Bureau to check the files, you keep an eye on the results." With insufficient police force at his disposal, he could only temporarily set aside dealing with me, the "traitor." With that, he grabbed his car keys and rushed out, driving straight to the Human Resources Bureau, almost running a red light on the way.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">欧文没等科尔，自己先赶回警局，正好撞上刚从化验室出来的维克托。维克托推了推眼镜，低声说："查出来了，那退役军人叫罗德·英格恩，空军特战队前指挥官，三年前海外任务标注死亡，现在又冒出来。数据库刚恢复。"他顿了顿，递给欧文一张打印的档案照片，"喏，这家伙。"欧文接过照片，又翻出马丁的夜景照一对，脸色沉得像锅底——海港照片里一行人中，有个侧脸跟罗德一模一样。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Owen didn't wait for Cole and headed back to the police station himself, coincidentally running into Victor, who had just emerged from the lab. Victor pushed up his glasses and said in a low voice: "We found it. That veteran is named Rod Ingrain, former commander of the Air Force Special Tactics Team. He was marked as deceased during an overseas mission three years ago, but now he's reappeared. The database was just restored." He paused, handing Owen a printed file photo, "Here, this guy." Owen took the photo, then pulled out Martin's night scene photos for comparison, his face as dark as the bottom of a pot—among the line of people in the harbor photo was a profile that looked exactly like Rod.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"谢了！"欧文拍拍维克托肩膀，随后又问："卢卡斯在哪？""在三区附近巡逻，他们最近忙的要死，我很久没见他们了。"欧文听后转身就走，决定先会会我。可维克托喊住他："你去哪？"欧文回头，维克托皱着眉，说："我去找卢卡斯。"维克托摸了摸下巴，他还憋着半句话没说，那张照片有一个熟人——鲍里斯，那时莱门斯原来的手下，后来调去了安全局，做了警长，前途不可限量，欧文为什么没有认出他来？维克托觉得这事不简单，他先去档案区完完整整的检查了档案，大吃一惊，然后深夜马不停蹄地跳上车直奔莱门斯家，想当面问问自己的疑惑。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Thanks!" Owen patted Victor's shoulder, then asked: "Where's Lucas?" "Patrolling near District Three. They've been insanely busy lately; I haven't seen them in a long time." After hearing this, Owen turned to leave, deciding to confront me first. But Victor called out to him: "Where are you going?" Owen turned back, and Victor, frowning, said: "I'm going to find Lucas." Victor stroked his chin; he was holding back something—that photo contained a familiar face—Boris, who used to be Lemons' subordinate and later transferred to the Security Bureau, becoming a chief with unlimited prospects. Why hadn't Owen recognized him? Victor felt that this matter wasn't simple. He first went to the archives area to thoroughly check the files, was greatly shocked, and then, late at night, tirelessly jumped into his car and headed straight for Lemons' house, wanting to ask about his doubts face to face.</p>
