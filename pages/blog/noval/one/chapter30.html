                    <p class="zh-content">维克托开车赶到莱门斯家时，天已经黑透了。莱门斯刚从旅店回来没多久，刚换上睡衣。维克托敲门进来，莱门斯抬头看了他一眼，挤出个笑："哟，我们的法医先生！大驾光临，这么晚了还跑我这儿？"维克托推了推眼镜，点点头："睡不着，有点事儿，想跟你聊聊。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">By the time Victor drove to Lemons' house, the sky had completely darkened. Lemons had returned from the motel not long ago and had just changed into his pajamas. Victor knocked and entered, and Lemons looked up at him, forcing a smile: "Well, our forensic doctor! What an honor, coming all the way here so late?" Victor pushed up his glasses, nodding: "Couldn't sleep, had something on my mind, wanted to talk to you."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"幸好我的太太和女儿们去了首都研学，否则她们肯定打爆我的头也不让你打扰我们休息。"莱门斯调侃道。维克托也笑了起来，气氛欢快。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"Fortunately, my wife and daughters went to the capital for a study trip, otherwise they would have surely beaten me senseless rather than let you disturb our rest," Lemons joked. Victor also laughed, creating a cheerful atmosphere.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">两人寒暄了几句，莱门斯起身去厨房泡茶，维克托坐在沙发上，揉了揉疲惫的眼睛，直奔主题："警长，你知道马丁的夜景照片吗？"莱门斯有点疑惑，笑着说："照片？哦！我们晚上审问了马丁，这应该是我找到的线索！能为你提供什么帮助？""我在上面看到了鲍里斯！天呐，是安全局的警长？和雇佣兵吗？欧文没认出他！"莱门斯背对着他，手里的茶壶顿了一下，瞳孔微微一缩，可转过身时脸上还是那副若无其事的笑。他端着两杯茶走过来，递给维克托一杯："鲍里斯！这是我的老熟人了，以前给我当搭档。说说看，你还发现了啥？我记得欧文是要去找卢卡斯的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"I saw Boris in it! My God, the chief from the Security Bureau? With mercenaries? Owen didn't recognize him!" Lemons, with his back turned, paused with the teapot in hand, his pupils slightly constricted, but when he turned around, his face still wore that casual smile. He walked over with two cups of tea, handing one to Victor: "Boris! He's an old acquaintance of mine, used to be my partner. Tell me, what else did you discover? I remember Owen was going to find Lucas."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"你现在的生活如何？"维克托接过茶，放松地抿了一口，开始回答莱门斯的问话："哈哈，多谢老警长还惦记我家里的事情，还不错，子女将来能上个好大学我就满足了。""工资如何？""不算多，但好在你的补贴让我慢慢富裕起来。""当初为什么当警察？""责任吧，我想把事情搞清楚。""对鲍里斯的出现有啥疑惑？""他是你原来的手下，我觉得有问题。"维克托语气真诚，眼里带着点疑惑，"有什么疑惑？老伙计，你今天疑神疑鬼的？把话说清楚！"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"How's your life these days?" Victor took the tea, relaxedly sipped it, and began to answer Lemons' questions: "Haha, thanks to the old chief for still thinking about my family affairs. Not bad, I'd be satisfied if my children could get into a good university in the future." "How's the salary?" "Not much, but thankfully your subsidies have gradually made me more affluent." "Why did you become a police officer initially?" "Responsibility, I guess. I wanted to clarify things." "What doubts do you have about Boris's appearance?" "He was your former subordinate; I think there's an issue." Victor's tone was sincere, his eyes showing a trace of doubt. "What doubts? Old buddy, you're being paranoid today. Speak clearly!"</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">"我看了十年前的一次扫黄行动的记录，那时候，鲍里斯和您一组负责一次企业家和明星的所谓婚礼派对，当时传闻有人拍摄了一位高官，可能是联邦检察官的不雅照片，但很快这项刑事指控被撤销了，您当时是主要负责人，鲍里斯负责整理证据。为什么法院撤销了指控，我想问问您的看法。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">"I looked at the records of an anti-vice operation from ten years ago. At that time, Boris and you were responsible for a so-called wedding party of entrepreneurs and celebrities. Rumors had it that someone had taken inappropriate photos of a high-ranking official, possibly a federal prosecutor, but the criminal charges were quickly dropped. You were the main person in charge at the time, with Boris responsible for organizing the evidence. I wanted to ask your opinion on why the court dismissed the charges."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯笑了笑，点点头，像在听老朋友唠嗑，"老伙计，我看你疯了！"就在维克托低头喝茶的瞬间，他猛地转身，从腰后掏出手枪，"砰"的一声，子弹正中维克托的心脏。维克托瞪大眼睛，茶杯摔在地上摔得粉碎，血从胸口喷出来，他张了张嘴，像想说什么，可没来得及出声就倒在沙发上，没了气息。莱门斯站在原地，低头看着尸体，眼神冷得像冰，嘴里嘀咕了句："维克托，你知道太多了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons smiled and nodded, as if listening to an old friend chatting, "Old buddy, I think you've gone mad!" Just as Victor lowered his head to drink his tea, Lemons suddenly turned, pulled out a gun from behind his waist, and with a "bang," the bullet hit Victor right in the heart. Victor's eyes widened, the teacup smashed to pieces on the floor, blood spurting from his chest. He opened and closed his mouth as if wanting to say something, but before he could make a sound, he collapsed on the sofa, lifeless. Lemons stood there, looking down at the body, his eyes cold as ice, muttering: "Victor, you knew too much."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">第二天，警局的新闻发布会上，莱门斯站在台上，西装笔挺，语气沉重："我很遗憾地宣布，我们的二级警督法医维克托·伦纳德昨晚在滨海公园遇刺身亡。"台下哗然一片，记者举起话筒，警员们低声议论，气氛像炸开了锅。莱门斯抬起手压了压，继续说："根据初步调查，维克托身中点32手枪击中心脏当场身亡，法医鉴定维克托死后被移动过，嫌疑人是三个街头浪人，动机可能是抢劫维克托的财物。他很勇敢，生前有搏斗痕迹，可惜没能撑过去。我要求所有人保持紧惕和小心，两人一组，摸排附近街区和可疑分子……"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The next day, at the police station press conference, Lemons stood on the stage, impeccably dressed in a suit, his tone solemn: "I regret to announce that our Level Two Forensic Superintendent Victor Leonard was stabbed to death last night in Coastal Park." There was an uproar below the stage, with reporters raising microphones and officers whispering among themselves, the atmosphere exploding like a pot. Lemons raised his hand to calm them, continuing: "According to the preliminary investigation, Victor was hit in the heart by a .32 caliber pistol and died on the spot. The forensic examination revealed that Victor's body was moved after death. The suspects are three street vagrants, and the motive may have been to rob Victor's possessions. He was brave; there were signs of struggle before his death, but unfortunately, he couldn't pull through. I require everyone to remain vigilant and careful, work in pairs, and investigate the nearby neighborhoods and suspicious individuals..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">科尔站在台下，眉头拧得像麻花。他上前一步，低声问："真实的死因是什么？具体时间呢？有目击者吗？"莱门斯瞥了他一眼，语气专业得滴水不漏："死因是胸部枪伤，时间大概是昨晚十点左右，公园附近没监控，没找到目击者。现场有搏斗痕迹，手表和钱包被抢走了。"科尔抿着嘴，没再追问，可心里却像点了一把火。"卢卡斯在哪？"莱门斯点了点头，认为科尔的怀疑很有道理，说道："他在三区巡逻，可能路过过滨海公园。我们得找到他，不能用公共频道，悄悄的。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Cole stood below the stage, his brows furrowed like a twist. He stepped forward and asked in a low voice: "What's the real cause of death? The specific time? Are there any witnesses?" Lemons glanced at him, his tone professionally watertight: "The cause of death is a chest gunshot wound, the time was around 10 PM last night. There's no surveillance near the park, and no witnesses have been found. There were signs of struggle at the scene, and his watch and wallet were stolen." Cole pressed his lips together, not asking further, but his heart was burning with questions. "Where's Lucas?" Lemons nodded, considering Cole's suspicion reasonable, and said: "He's patrolling in District Three, might have passed by Coastal Park. We need to find him, but not through the public channel, quietly."</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">发布会散了，科尔站在角落，低头翻着笔记本，眼底闪着冷光。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The press conference dispersed, Cole stood in the corner, looking down at his notebook, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p>
