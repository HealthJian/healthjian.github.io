                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">第二天一早，《梅罗德晨报》的头版头条炸开了锅。一篇署名"匿名人士"的文章赫然在目：《港口枪战疑犯最后晚餐曝光，海鲜饭藏致命线索？》。文章写得半真半假，提到了尸体胃里的新鲜海鲜面，地点模糊指向海港附近，还添了点耸人听闻的猜测，像"犯罪网络的最后晚餐"之类的话。马丁这家伙效率奇高，直接把这篇扔上了头条，配了张港口爆炸的照片，标题红得像血，街头报摊瞬间卖疯了。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Early the next morning, the headline of the Melrod Morning News exploded. An article signed by "Anonymous" was prominently displayed: "Port Gunfight Suspect's Last Supper Revealed, Seafood Rice Conceals Deadly Clue?" The article was written half-true and half-false, mentioning the fresh seafood noodles in the corpse's stomach, vaguely pointing to somewhere near the harbor, and adding some sensational speculation, like talk of "the criminal network's last supper." Martin, that guy, was incredibly efficient, directly throwing this piece onto the headline, paired with a photo of the port explosion, the title as red as blood, and street newsstands instantly sold out.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">城市里的餐饮店炸了窝，尤其是海港附近的饭店老板们如坐针毡。有的急忙在门口贴出"本店不卖海鲜面"的告示，有的干脆关门歇业，生怕被牵连。街头巷尾都在议论，有人说是帮派内讧，有人猜是恐怖分子，连卖早点的大妈都凑热闹："昨儿我还卖了两碗海鲜面，不会是我吧？"一时间，梅罗德像是被这篇报道点了把火，烧得人心惶惶。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">The city's restaurants were in an uproar, especially the restaurant owners near the harbor who were on pins and needles. Some hurriedly posted notices at their doors saying "This shop does not sell seafood noodles," while others simply closed for business, afraid of being implicated. Streets and alleys were all abuzz with discussion, some saying it was gang infighting, some guessing it was terrorists, even the breakfast-selling aunties joined in the excitement: "Yesterday I sold two bowls of seafood noodles, it couldn't be me, right?" For a time, Melrod seemed to have been set ablaze by this report, burning with anxiety.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">警局里，科尔得知消息时正在喝咖啡，看到报纸后一口喷了出来，脸黑得像锅底。他把报纸往桌上一摔，冲进会议室，指着情报科和行动组的人吼："谁他妈泄的密？纪律呢？你们眼里还有没有规矩？"他气得声音都抖了，"每人记过一次，写报告交上来！"屋里的人低着头，没一个敢吭声。迈克小声嘀咕："这小子发起火来还真吓人。"托马斯瞥了他一眼，耸了耸肩，"我们有的忙了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">In the police station, Cole was drinking coffee when he heard the news, and after seeing the newspaper, he spat it out in shock, his face as black as the bottom of a pot. He slammed the newspaper onto the table, rushed into the conference room, and shouted at the intelligence department and action team: "Who the fuck leaked the secret? Where's the discipline? Do you still have any rules in your eyes?" He was so angry his voice trembled, "Everyone gets a demerit, write reports and submit them!" The people in the room lowered their heads, not one daring to make a sound. Mike whispered: "This guy is really scary when he gets angry." Thomas glanced at him, shrugged, "We have a lot to busy ourselves with."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯听到风声，急匆匆走进办公室，手里照旧端着咖啡。他扫了眼桌上的报纸，嘴角微微一撇，对科尔说："年轻人，火气别这么大。"说完他放下杯子，语气沉下来，"立刻安排人，放下手里的活儿，全城调查卖海鲜面的地方——饭店、超市、便当铺、快餐车，一个不落。"屋里的人一听，脸都绿了。这任务量大得吓人，梅罗德满城跑腿都查不完，警员们怨声载道，低声骂："早干嘛去了？科尔不早通报案情，现在让我们擦屁股。"有人偷偷瞪了科尔一眼，埋怨他把这线索捂得太死。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons, hearing the news, hurriedly walked into the office, still holding a cup of coffee in his hand. He glanced at the newspaper on the desk, his mouth slightly skewed, and said to Cole: "Young man, don't be so hot-tempered." Then he put down his cup, his tone becoming serious, "Arrange people immediately, put down whatever you're doing, investigate seafood noodle sellers throughout the city—restaurants, supermarkets, bento shops, food trucks, don't miss a single one." When the people in the room heard this, their faces turned green. The workload was frighteningly large, running all over Melrod wouldn't be enough to check everything, and the officers grumbled, cursing under their breath: "What were we doing earlier? Cole didn't report the case details earlier, and now he's making us clean up the mess." Someone secretly glared at Cole, blaming him for keeping this clue so tightly under wraps.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">莱门斯没理会这些抱怨，转头看向科尔，眼神冷得像刀子："这就是你的谨慎？这'内鬼'你给我找出来，不然这锅你来背。"科尔抿了抿嘴，低声应了句："是，警长。"可他眼底闪过一丝愤怒，决心揪出这个败类。</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Lemons ignored these complaints, turned to look at Cole, his eyes cold as a knife: "Is this your caution? Find me this 'mole', otherwise you'll take the blame." Cole pressed his lips together, responding in a low voice: "Yes, Chief." But a flash of anger appeared in his eyes, determined to root out this scoundrel.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">我窝在家里，电视开着，新闻里正播报这条头条的后续效应。看着屏幕上饭店老板慌张的脸和警员疲惫跑腿的背影，我心里有点虚，又有点暗爽。没人知道是我干的，至少现在没人知道。我点了根烟，吐出去，盯着窗外戒严的街道，短信提示我到账五万元，这够我十年的年薪。左臂的伤口还隐隐作痛，脑子里突然出现安德利的脸——拍着我肩膀笑道："这该死的世界，你还真敢捅娄子。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">I curled up at home, with the TV on, the news reporting the follow-up effects of this headline. Looking at the panicked faces of restaurant owners and the tired figures of police officers running errands on the screen, I felt a bit uneasy, yet also a bit of secret satisfaction. No one knew I did it, at least not now. I lit a cigarette, exhaled, staring at the streets under martial law outside the window, a text message notifying me that fifty thousand yuan had been deposited, enough for ten years of my annual salary. The wound on my left arm still ached faintly, and suddenly Andrey's face appeared in my mind—patting my shoulder and smiling: "This damned world, you really dare to stir up trouble."</p>

                <div class="bilingual-content">
                    <p class="zh-content">警局那边，科尔回到办公桌前，摊开地图，手指在海港附近划来划去，嘴里嘀咕："操，现在打草惊蛇，鬼知道会发生什么！"他咬了咬牙，抓起电话，开始调监控和饭店名单、财产明细表，找来了秘书、文职、实习警察，吩咐大家一起熬夜再查一遍。莱门斯站在窗边，抽着雪茄，眯眼看着外头的混乱，低声自语："这水，越来越浑了。"</p>
                    <p class="en-content" style="display: none;">Back at the police station, Cole returned to his desk, spread out a map, his finger moving back and forth near the harbor, muttering: "Damn, now that we've alarmed the snake by striking the grass, who knows what will happen!" He bit his lip, grabbed the phone, and started checking surveillance footage, restaurant lists, and property inventory sheets, brought in secretaries, civilian staff, and intern police officers, instructing everyone to work overnight to check everything again. Lemons stood by the window, smoking a cigar, squinting at the chaos outside, murmuring to himself: "The waters are getting murkier."</p>
